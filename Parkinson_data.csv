I‚Äôll use my allotted space to make you aware of a fabulous organization ‚Äì the NeuroChallenge Foundation for Parkinson‚Äôs (NCF) https://www.parkinsonsneurochallenge.org/\nNCF is located in Sarasota, Florida, and has been serving the PD community for over ten years. From humble beginnings, NCF has blossomed and\xa0 become the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù source of PD-related information, programming and counselling for all of Southwest Florida (and beyond). When a ‚ÄúSun Coast‚Äù resident receives that first PD diagnosis, they are almost always advised to contact NCF for guidance and support along this new, challenging journey.\nThe heart of NCF is the remarkable group of Care Advisors who interact every day with patients and caregivers. These are the folks who are on the front line of the PD battlefield, striving to support the PD community so that no one feels that they are making the journey alone. Led by a brilliant and driven Executive Director and a Board of Directors \xa0who are deeply involved in fulfilling NCF‚Äôs mission of improving the quality of life of people with Parkinson‚Äôs and their caregivers, NCF accomplishes its goals with a staff of only 7 dedicated people and a large group of volunteers.\nI must mention specifically one outstanding annual event. In 2020, NCF‚Äôs annual Expo attracted more than 1,400 attendees eager to hear the latest about PD research, medications and other aspects of PD patient support. Between presentations by distinguished speakers, attendees are free to wander around the corridors, where representatives from drug companies, hospitals, makers of assistive devices, counsellors, etc. are happy to answer questions. I want to note that NCF‚Äôs expenses are funded from only two sources ‚Äì donations and, to a much lesser extent, grants (no government support).\nSo, why am I telling you about NCF, other than to ‚Äútoot our horn‚Äù to a wider audience than usual? Because I believe that the NCF model could be replicated in many locations in the US and internationally. I believe that an organization like NCF can be created wherever there is a critical mass of motivated PD patients and caregivers who are yearning to expand their treatment horizons.\nAdmittedly, NCF has grown because of its rather unique demography.\xa0 Sarasota has a much higher than usual percentage of senior citizens. That means higher than expected counts of PD patients, many of whom live at a distance from family and need support. NCF has been blessed with financial support from very generous ‚Äúangel investors‚Äù as well as receiving thousands of contributions from others whose lives have been impacted by PD.\nSorry, I went way over my allotted space.

But I am intimidated from engaging any major complex projects. So I cut back as best I can. But I enjoy the work that I do and the meaning it gives to me. My brother says that I should retire but that doesn‚Äôt feel like an option. Maybe he‚Äôs right.\nI also am hesitant about engaging in events, not being sure how I‚Äôll be, whether it‚Äôs going to a concert, the movies, or a party. I fear disappointing friends and then being less involved with me. So I try to keep up via text or phone calls and selective social events.I am generally very outgoing \xa0So that is a change.\nDue to the dopamine deficit, I don‚Äôt have the same zest for things that I had. For example, I like to watch sports and I don‚Äôt have any excitement about that.\nTo balance what seems like this tale of woe, I should add that I do enjoy things on some level and I try to not think about the apathy. In other words I try mindful awareness of being in the present moment and appreciating that, such as seeing the sunshine outside the window, the taste of coffee and sweets üôÇ\nWhat has remained the same are my social skills and my cognitive abilities. One of my strategies is, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got Parkinson‚Äôs. Get over it.‚Äú I don‚Äôt mean this is easy or to be glib but it‚Äôs a process of accepting it for life instead of regretting or fighting it. I have no choice! Except in how I focus on the present and the gifts in my life. They include the support of people in my life.\nOh and I see a counselor for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. She is part of the neurology office that I go to.It helps remind me how to stay engaged and be in the present.\n'], ['\nGarrett,\nIt sounds like you‚Äôre managing PD in the best ways that you know how. I don‚Äôt think anyone can ask for more than that. I‚Äôve often felt that hanging on to the things that give us meaning can give me strength to get through the hard parts. But it seems like you‚Äôre finding meaning in a lot of things. Have you found that counseling has helped?\n'], ['\nYes. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) is a mindfulness based approach. It emphasizes being present in the moment and being with it rather than fretting or being in the future or past. It is so easy to slip into, ‚Äúhow are used to be when I was without Parkinson ‚Äúor ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù. With ACT One dozen try to dispute those thoughts but rather moves into a present tense mindful breathing focus. Kind of like intentional forgetting of what your mine was doing. It is considered a third wave of behavioral counseling.\n'], ['\nMy neuro told me to make a conscious effort to try to focus on a thought instead of trying to get everything done on my list. I was always proud of how I got everything done.

My days would start at 6:50 and I did not return home until 4 or 5 o‚Äôclock, with paperwork to do in the evenings. In addition, I was caring for my elderly parents who were living in an Assisted Living facility. By January of 2019, both parents had passed and my husband had too many days where he wasn‚Äôt safe at home alone. So, I decided to retire a bit earlier than I had expected. Due to RLS, there are a few days per month that we sleep only a few hours a night. Retiring has allowed me to rest up after nights like this rather than running myself ragged. I have become the sole driver, as it isn‚Äôt safe for him to be behind the wheel anymore. I must be with him in a doctor‚Äôs office, as he is easily confused with directions or instructions. His anxiety can keep us from going certain places. I try to encourage him with reassurances that if he becomes uncomfortable, we will leave. The biggest problem with that relates to his struggles with constipation. It can take him an entire day with multiple trips to the bathroom before he can find relief. For all of these symptoms, he takes medicines, supplements, teas, lots of fiber and exercise. My new full time job is making sure I am there to support his physical, mental, and emotional health. I feel okay with this new normal because I am so lucky to have had him on my life.

Thankfully I have many life-lines: our daughters, our grandchildren, our church, our friends, and my amazing Parkinson‚Äôs support group.\nUnless you live with someone with Parkinson‚Äôs, you cannot fully understand the many emotions caregivers feel and the various problems we have to solve. We need to hear that our feelings are normal, that someone understands us,\xa0 and that we are not alone. The fellow caregivers in my support group have encouraged me to write a blog that has resonated with many caregivers around the world.

I‚Äôll use my allotted space to make you aware of a fabulous organization ‚Äì the NeuroChallenge Foundation for Parkinson‚Äôs (NCF) https://www.parkinsonsneurochallenge.org/\nNCF is located in Sarasota, Florida, and has been serving the PD community for over ten years. From humble beginnings, NCF has blossomed and\xa0 become the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù source of PD-related information, programming and counselling for all of Southwest Florida (and beyond). When a ‚ÄúSun Coast‚Äù resident receives that first PD diagnosis, they are almost always advised to contact NCF for guidance and support along this new, challenging journey.\nThe heart of NCF is the remarkable group of Care Advisors who interact every day with patients and caregivers. These are the folks who are on the front line of the PD battlefield, striving to support the PD community so that no one feels that they are making the journey alone. Led by a brilliant and driven Executive Director and a Board of Directors \xa0who are deeply involved in fulfilling NCF‚Äôs mission of improving the quality of life of people with Parkinson‚Äôs and their caregivers, NCF accomplishes its goals with a staff of only 7 dedicated people and a large group of volunteers.\nI must mention specifically one outstanding annual event. In 2020, NCF‚Äôs annual Expo attracted more than 1,400 attendees eager to hear the latest about PD research, medications and other aspects of PD patient support. Between presentations by distinguished speakers, attendees are free to wander around the corridors, where representatives from drug companies, hospitals, makers of assistive devices, counsellors, etc. are happy to answer questions. I want to note that NCF‚Äôs expenses are funded from only two sources ‚Äì donations and, to a much lesser extent, grants (no government support).\nSo, why am I telling you about NCF, other than to ‚Äútoot our horn‚Äù to a wider audience than usual? Because I believe that the NCF model could be replicated in many locations in the US and internationally. I believe that an organization like NCF can be created wherever there is a critical mass of motivated PD patients and caregivers who are yearning to expand their treatment horizons.\nAdmittedly, NCF has grown because of its rather unique demography.\xa0 Sarasota has a much higher than usual percentage of senior citizens. That means higher than expected counts of PD patients, many of whom live at a distance from family and need support. NCF has been blessed with financial support from very generous ‚Äúangel investors‚Äù as well as receiving thousands of contributions from others whose lives have been impacted by PD.\nSorry, I went way over my allotted space. April is PD Awareness Month, and I feel strongly that my PD ‚Äúsisters and brothers‚Äù should be aware of what can be accomplished.\nBe well.\nSteve Oppen\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nHey everyone!

What other habits or routines have shifted in your life?\n'], ['\nIn many ways. I was diagnosed 10 years ago and I‚Äôve watched the progression over those 10 years. It seems like my biggest concern is about my career.As I may have mentioned before, I work as a professor, which allows me to work at home much of the time and to cut back from my long hours that I formerly worked. Due to symptoms,I am anxious about going into class, fearing that my tremor will return and the other symptoms like the ‚Äúfoggy brain‚Äù phenomenon.\nI‚Äôve gotten some help with accommodations at work like having a teaching assistant in all my classes to take care of the details which overwhelmed me. But I am intimidated from engaging any major complex projects. So I cut back as best I can. But I enjoy the work that I do and the meaning it gives to me. My brother says that I should retire but that doesn‚Äôt feel like an option. Maybe he‚Äôs right.\nI also am hesitant about engaging in events, not being sure how I‚Äôll be, whether it‚Äôs going to a concert, the movies, or a party. I fear disappointing friends and then being less involved with me. So I try to keep up via text or phone calls and selective social events.I am generally very outgoing \xa0So that is a change.\nDue to the dopamine deficit, I don‚Äôt have the same zest for things that I had. For example, I like to watch sports and I don‚Äôt have any excitement about that.\nTo balance what seems like this tale of woe, I should add that I do enjoy things on some level and I try to not think about the apathy. In other words I try mindful awareness of being in the present moment and appreciating that, such as seeing the sunshine outside the window, the taste of coffee and sweets üôÇ\nWhat has remained the same are my social skills and my cognitive abilities. One of my strategies is, ‚Äúyou‚Äôve got Parkinson‚Äôs. Get over it.‚Äú I don‚Äôt mean this is easy or to be glib but it‚Äôs a process of accepting it for life instead of regretting or fighting it.

It emphasizes being present in the moment and being with it rather than fretting or being in the future or past. It is so easy to slip into, ‚Äúhow are used to be when I was without Parkinson ‚Äúor ‚Äúwhy me?‚Äù. With ACT One dozen try to dispute those thoughts but rather moves into a present tense mindful breathing focus. Kind of like intentional forgetting of what your mine was doing.

In addition, I was caring for my elderly parents who were living in an Assisted Living facility. By January of 2019, both parents had passed and my husband had too many days where he wasn‚Äôt safe at home alone. So, I decided to retire a bit earlier than I had expected. Due to RLS, there are a few days per month that we sleep only a few hours a night. Retiring has allowed me to rest up after nights like this rather than running myself ragged. I have become the sole driver, as it isn‚Äôt safe for him to be behind the wheel anymore. I must be with him in a doctor‚Äôs office, as he is easily confused with directions or instructions. His anxiety can keep us from going certain places. I try to encourage him with reassurances that if he becomes uncomfortable, we will leave. The biggest problem with that relates to his struggles with constipation. It can take him an entire day with multiple trips to the bathroom before he can find relief. For all of these symptoms, he takes medicines, supplements, teas, lots of fiber and exercise. My new full time job is making sure I am there to support his physical, mental, and emotional health.

I‚Äôll use my allotted space to make you aware of a fabulous organization ‚Äì the NeuroChallenge Foundation for Parkinson‚Äôs (NCF) https://www.parkinsonsneurochallenge.org/\nNCF is located in Sarasota, Florida, and has been serving the PD community for over ten years. From humble beginnings, NCF has blossomed and\xa0 become the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù source of PD-related information, programming and counselling for all of Southwest Florida (and beyond). When a ‚ÄúSun Coast‚Äù resident receives that first PD diagnosis, they are almost always advised to contact NCF for guidance and support along this new, challenging journey.\nThe heart of NCF is the remarkable group of Care Advisors who interact every day with patients and caregivers. These are the folks who are on the front line of the PD battlefield, striving to support the PD community so that no one feels that they are making the journey alone. Led by a brilliant and driven Executive Director and a Board of Directors \xa0who are deeply involved in fulfilling NCF‚Äôs mission of improving the quality of life of people with Parkinson‚Äôs and their caregivers, NCF accomplishes its goals with a staff of only 7 dedicated people and a large group of volunteers.\nI must mention specifically one outstanding annual event. In 2020, NCF‚Äôs annual Expo attracted more than 1,400 attendees eager to hear the latest about PD research, medications and other aspects of PD patient support. Between presentations by distinguished speakers, attendees are free to wander around the corridors, where representatives from drug companies, hospitals, makers of assistive devices, counsellors, etc. are happy to answer questions. I want to note that NCF‚Äôs expenses are funded from only two sources ‚Äì donations and, to a much lesser extent, grants (no government support).\nSo, why am I telling you about NCF, other than to ‚Äútoot our horn‚Äù to a wider audience than usual? Because I believe that the NCF model could be replicated in many locations in the US and internationally. I believe that an organization like NCF can be created wherever there is a critical mass of motivated PD patients and caregivers who are yearning to expand their treatment horizons.\nAdmittedly, NCF has grown because of its rather unique demography.\xa0 Sarasota has a much higher than usual percentage of senior citizens. That means higher than expected counts of PD patients, many of whom live at a distance from family and need support. NCF has been blessed with financial support from very generous ‚Äúangel investors‚Äù as well as receiving thousands of contributions from others whose lives have been impacted by PD.\nSorry, I went way over my allotted space.

It seems like my biggest concern is about my career.As I may have mentioned before, I work as a professor, which allows me to work at home much of the time and to cut back from my long hours that I formerly worked. Due to symptoms,I am anxious about going into class, fearing that my tremor will return and the other symptoms like the ‚Äúfoggy brain‚Äù phenomenon.\nI‚Äôve gotten some help with accommodations at work like having a teaching assistant in all my classes to take care of the details which overwhelmed me.

For example, I like to watch sports and I don‚Äôt have any excitement about that.\nTo balance what seems like this tale of woe, I should add that I do enjoy things on some level and I try to not think about the apathy. In other words I try mindful awareness of being in the present moment and appreciating that, such as seeing the sunshine outside the window, the taste of coffee and sweets üôÇ\nWhat has remained the same are my social skills and my cognitive abilities.

Freezing of gait (FOG) is the result of the degeneration of the neurons in the substantia negra which are responsible for initiating movement. The only way to start moving is either to use some cue, for example, through the use of a laser pointer, or simply by concentrating on walking, in other words, giving your brain time to use another neural pathway since the automatic response is no longer available.\n'], ['\nThanks for your thoughts, Chris.

I have two brothers-in-law with PD, one dead already and the other in advanced state. Not related by blood. Although my mother and one of her brothers both had Alzheimers in their 80s. I am still in my 60s. So my theory goes like this: back in the day when i was still a journalist, we worked on stories about dentists and others polluting the water supply with stuff not filtered out or treated by chlorine. The dentists in Montreal, where I and my two brothers-in-law were born and raised, habitually flushed dental amalgam into the sewers. Now that‚Äôs not commonly used any more, but it is composed of heavy metals, like mercury, silver and\xa0 copper ‚Äì which my neurologist has told me is linked to PD.So we grew up drinking city water we thought was clean but had all these toxic heavy metals, and nowadays things like Prozac and other drugs people flush down the toilet. Never dispose of pharmaceuticals that way, folks! Anyway it would be interesting to find out how much amalgam made it into the water supply of cities across North America, and has this practice ended? I mean it‚Äôs 50% mercury, and we know what mercury can do to you‚Ä¶ or do we?

It explains the process of prionization (how misfolded proteins go on to misfold other proteins, spreading like a virus in the body). All of the protein misfolding diseases have this feature (Alzheimer‚Äôs, ALS, etc).\nhttps://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374536596\nBut there is alot of research about PD as an auto-immune disease, where our immune system begins to attack things (like neurons in our brains) it should not be attacking. PD is now considered a constellation of symptoms/syndromes. There is a wealth of info here (and a webinar specifically on the immune system):\nhttps://www.michaeljfox.org/webinars\nWhen I was diagnosed 4 years ago with\xa0 young onset, I did a ton of research and immediately started high intensity interval training and eating an anti-inflammatory, autoimmune type diet. I reversed and eliminated all of my non-motor symptoms (which for me looked like Fibromyalgia). Every now and then I get a flare up of non-motor symptoms if I am especially stressed and/or I let up on the exercise and diet. My tremor has progressed, however, because right now there is no known way to stop the prionization process. But what I have seen is that the disease trajectory is highly individualized.\nHope this helps.\n'], ['\nDavid,\nThank you for your response. Wow!

I‚Äôve ordered some but not sure if it‚Äôs the right one‚Ä¶\n'], ['\nVery interesting questions and answers.\n'], ['\nFascinating discussion. You ask why Parkinson‚Äôs can be a disease if there is no pathogen. While the evidence is strong that alpha synuclein is associated with PD and is produced in the gut and somehow migrates up the vagus nerve, the mechanism by which this happens is elusive. In the same way that the high concentration of the amyloid beta peptide contributes to amyloid plaques in Alzheimer‚Äôs, alpha synuclein contributes to the Lewy bodies. The amyloid beta peptide in the brain acts as an antimicrobial and there is a school of thought that believes that AD is the result of a low grade infection in the brain. This would account for the singular lack of efficacy of drugs that seek to reduce the levels of amyloid plaques in the brain. I am similarly skeptical that alpha-synuclein is at the root of the disease.\nOver the last 60 years, there has been a steady increase in the levels of many autoimmune diseases including MS, Crohn‚Äôs and Type 2 diabetes. Other reports have suggested that AD is also on the rise and its rise cannot be explained by an aging population alone. I have not seen corresponding data for PD but I suspect that the same is true. While there are huge numbers of possible explanations for this, one phenomenon that tracks with these increases is antibiotic and antifungal usage. A recent paper looking at antibiotic use in Finland supports this thesis.\nMany autoimmune conditions such as MS and PD share certain common features ‚Äì a primary neurological feature and a multiplicity of comorbidities that vary from patient to patient. There is little to no understanding of the root cause of the disease, hence your question. Inflammation is at the root of most autoimmune conditions including PD and medications are palliative at best and there is no known cure.\nIf inflammation is at the root, what could cause it? We know that there are microbes in blood and that they are difficult to culture. These could account for the low-grade inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system on their degradation. I would recommend that you look at a paper by Martin Laurence, doi: 10.3389/fneur.2019.00758. I believe that he is on the right track. My thinking is that there is a fungal infection is at the root and that the comorbidities are due to a blood bacterial microbiome that is unique to each person.\nHeavy metals and pesticides can change the composition of the blood microbiome and could thus likely contribute to PD.\nI would be happy to expand on this thinking should you wish.\n'], ['\nThank you, John, for the reference to the Laurence et al. article in Neurology Frontiers 10.3389/fneur.2019.00758. I have not read it thoroughly but lo and behold it begins with a discussion of seborrheic psoriasis as a strongly correlated symptom, suggesting fungal linkages. Not only do i suffer from this (I originally attributed it to UV damage to skin tissue), this was, now that i reflect back, one of the first of my symptoms to appear, long before anyone would have imagined PD! (Dermatologists should be coached to spot this‚Ä¶)\xa0 And Robin‚Äôs thoughts on prionization are also quite apt. Remember the pathogen in Creutzfeld Jacob aka mad cow‚Ä¶ is a prion.\xa0 The resemblances to auto-immune disorders are also tempting. My interest in all this, naturally, is simply to understand, and thereby somehow STOP what is happening to ME. I find Ibuprophen 200mg at bedtime to be useful (speaks to inflammation as a factor; Also I think nighttime muscle cramps have some inflammatory roots‚Ä¶) I too have been a lot better since joining a gym a few weeks ago ‚Äì and I started on Russ‚Äôs butyric acid two days ago. (i‚Äôll let you know how this goes). Even before that I was immeasurably better, still have ‚Äúbad‚Äù days, but overall people have noticed a change, like ‚Äúnight and day,‚Äù said one close friend. There‚Äôs a lot of chicken and egg in this story. I feel better since resuming resistance training at the gym, but only when I began to feel better did i even think i was capable of going to the gym again. Definitely a psych factor(s) is/are at play here. So how does ‚Äúpositive attitude‚Äù get expressed bio-chemically? I‚Äôd love to know the answer to that one. And then there‚Äôs the fulfilment one gets from solid friendships and rewarding physical relationships with one‚Äôs partner(s). Research published last July suggests PD symptoms are mitigated through sexual activity, but that this was more beneficial to males than females‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to learn more about that too‚Ä¶ John, you did not mention asthma as an auto-immune disease whose prevalence has risen enormously in past two decades, especially among children. Antibacterial soaps were to blame, according to one hypothesis. And then there‚Äôs all these cases of anaphylactic shock from foods once thought harmless (peanuts, e.g.). then again peanuts have a fungal toxin thought to be the trigger‚Ä¶ Hmmm. It would be nice to hear any further thoughts any of you might have, especially John, who has already offered to expand on his observations, and perhaps Robin would care to share the basics of his ‚Äúanti-inflammatory, autoimmune type diet.‚Äù\xa0 Also if anyone knows of a good remedy for seborrheic psoriasis‚Ä¶ It must be common, but you don‚Äôt hear much about it. Had my dermatologist known about this correlation, my PD might have been detected four years earlier, with less damage to my life.

The dentists in Montreal, where I and my two brothers-in-law were born and raised, habitually flushed dental amalgam into the sewers. Now that‚Äôs not commonly used any more, but it is composed of heavy metals, like mercury, silver and\xa0 copper ‚Äì which my neurologist has told me is linked to PD.So we grew up drinking city water we thought was clean but had all these toxic heavy metals, and nowadays things like Prozac and other drugs people flush down the toilet. Never dispose of pharmaceuticals that way, folks!

All of the protein misfolding diseases have this feature (Alzheimer‚Äôs, ALS, etc).\nhttps://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374536596\nBut there is alot of research about PD as an auto-immune disease, where our immune system begins to attack things (like neurons in our brains) it should not be attacking. PD is now considered a constellation of symptoms/syndromes. There is a wealth of info here (and a webinar specifically on the immune system):\nhttps://www.michaeljfox.org/webinars\nWhen I was diagnosed 4 years ago with\xa0 young onset, I did a ton of research and immediately started high intensity interval training and eating an anti-inflammatory, autoimmune type diet.

I‚Äôve ordered some but not sure if it‚Äôs the right one‚Ä¶\n'], ['\nVery interesting questions and answers.\n'], ['\nFascinating discussion. You ask why Parkinson‚Äôs can be a disease if there is no pathogen. While the evidence is strong that alpha synuclein is associated with PD and is produced in the gut and somehow migrates up the vagus nerve, the mechanism by which this happens is elusive. In the same way that the high concentration of the amyloid beta peptide contributes to amyloid plaques in Alzheimer‚Äôs, alpha synuclein contributes to the Lewy bodies. The amyloid beta peptide in the brain acts as an antimicrobial and there is a school of thought that believes that AD is the result of a low grade infection in the brain. This would account for the singular lack of efficacy of drugs that seek to reduce the levels of amyloid plaques in the brain. I am similarly skeptical that alpha-synuclein is at the root of the disease.\nOver the last 60 years, there has been a steady increase in the levels of many autoimmune diseases including MS, Crohn‚Äôs and Type 2 diabetes. Other reports have suggested that AD is also on the rise and its rise cannot be explained by an aging population alone. I have not seen corresponding data for PD but I suspect that the same is true. While there are huge numbers of possible explanations for this, one phenomenon that tracks with these increases is antibiotic and antifungal usage. A recent paper looking at antibiotic use in Finland supports this thesis.\nMany autoimmune conditions such as MS and PD share certain common features ‚Äì a primary neurological feature and a multiplicity of comorbidities that vary from patient to patient. There is little to no understanding of the root cause of the disease, hence your question. Inflammation is at the root of most autoimmune conditions including PD and medications are palliative at best and there is no known cure.\nIf inflammation is at the root, what could cause it? We know that there are microbes in blood and that they are difficult to culture. These could account for the low-grade inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system on their degradation. I would recommend that you look at a paper by Martin Laurence, doi: 10.3389/fneur.2019.00758. I believe that he is on the right track. My thinking is that there is a fungal infection is at the root and that the comorbidities are due to a blood bacterial microbiome that is unique to each person.\nHeavy metals and pesticides can change the composition of the blood microbiome and could thus likely contribute to PD.\nI would be happy to expand on this thinking should you wish.\n'], ['\nThank you, John, for the reference to the Laurence et al. article in Neurology Frontiers 10.3389/fneur.2019.00758. I have not read it thoroughly but lo and behold it begins with a discussion of seborrheic psoriasis as a strongly correlated symptom, suggesting fungal linkages. Not only do i suffer from this (I originally attributed it to UV damage to skin tissue), this was, now that i reflect back, one of the first of my symptoms to appear, long before anyone would have imagined PD! (Dermatologists should be coached to spot this‚Ä¶)\xa0 And Robin‚Äôs thoughts on prionization are also quite apt. Remember the pathogen in Creutzfeld Jacob aka mad cow‚Ä¶ is a prion.\xa0 The resemblances to auto-immune disorders are also tempting. My interest in all this, naturally, is simply to understand, and thereby somehow STOP what is happening to ME. I find Ibuprophen 200mg at bedtime to be useful (speaks to inflammation as a factor; Also I think nighttime muscle cramps have some inflammatory roots‚Ä¶) I too have been a lot better since joining a gym a few weeks ago ‚Äì and I started on Russ‚Äôs butyric acid two days ago. (i‚Äôll let you know how this goes). Even before that I was immeasurably better, still have ‚Äúbad‚Äù days, but overall people have noticed a change, like ‚Äúnight and day,‚Äù said one close friend. There‚Äôs a lot of chicken and egg in this story. I feel better since resuming resistance training at the gym, but only when I began to feel better did i even think i was capable of going to the gym again. Definitely a psych factor(s) is/are at play here. So how does ‚Äúpositive attitude‚Äù get expressed bio-chemically? I‚Äôd love to know the answer to that one. And then there‚Äôs the fulfilment one gets from solid friendships and rewarding physical relationships with one‚Äôs partner(s). Research published last July suggests PD symptoms are mitigated through sexual activity, but that this was more beneficial to males than females‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd like to learn more about that too‚Ä¶ John, you did not mention asthma as an auto-immune disease whose prevalence has risen enormously in past two decades, especially among children. Antibacterial soaps were to blame, according to one hypothesis. And then there‚Äôs all these cases of anaphylactic shock from foods once thought harmless (peanuts, e.g.). then again peanuts have a fungal toxin thought to be the trigger‚Ä¶ Hmmm. It would be nice to hear any further thoughts any of you might have, especially John, who has already offered to expand on his observations, and perhaps Robin would care to share the basics of his ‚Äúanti-inflammatory, autoimmune type diet.‚Äù\xa0 Also if anyone knows of a good remedy for seborrheic psoriasis‚Ä¶ It must be common, but you don‚Äôt hear much about it.

All of the protein misfolding diseases have this feature (Alzheimer‚Äôs, ALS, etc).\nhttps://us.macmillan.com/books/9780374536596\nBut there is alot of research about PD as an auto-immune disease, where our immune system begins to attack things (like neurons in our brains) it should not be attacking.

You ask why Parkinson‚Äôs can be a disease if there is no pathogen. While the evidence is strong that alpha synuclein is associated with PD and is produced in the gut and somehow migrates up the vagus nerve, the mechanism by which this happens is elusive. In the same way that the high concentration of the amyloid beta peptide contributes to amyloid plaques in Alzheimer‚Äôs, alpha synuclein contributes to the Lewy bodies. The amyloid beta peptide in the brain acts as an antimicrobial and there is a school of thought that believes that AD is the result of a low grade infection in the brain. This would account for the singular lack of efficacy of drugs that seek to reduce the levels of amyloid plaques in the brain. I am similarly skeptical that alpha-synuclein is at the root of the disease.\nOver the last 60 years, there has been a steady increase in the levels of many autoimmune diseases including MS, Crohn‚Äôs and Type 2 diabetes. Other reports have suggested that AD is also on the rise and its rise cannot be explained by an aging population alone. I have not seen corresponding data for PD but I suspect that the same is true. While there are huge numbers of possible explanations for this, one phenomenon that tracks with these increases is antibiotic and antifungal usage. A recent paper looking at antibiotic use in Finland supports this thesis.\nMany autoimmune conditions such as MS and PD share certain common features ‚Äì a primary neurological feature and a multiplicity of comorbidities that vary from patient to patient. There is little to no understanding of the root cause of the disease, hence your question. Inflammation is at the root of most autoimmune conditions including PD and medications are palliative at best and there is no known cure.\nIf inflammation is at the root, what could cause it? We know that there are microbes in blood and that they are difficult to culture. These could account for the low-grade inflammation by stimulating the innate immune system on their degradation. I would recommend that you look at a paper by Martin Laurence, doi: 10.3389/fneur.2019.00758. I believe that he is on the right track. My thinking is that there is a fungal infection is at the root and that the comorbidities are due to a blood bacterial microbiome that is unique to each person.\nHeavy metals and pesticides can change the composition of the blood microbiome and could thus likely contribute to PD.\nI would be happy to expand on this thinking should you wish.\n'], ['\nThank you, John, for the reference to the Laurence et al. article in Neurology Frontiers 10.3389/fneur.2019.00758. I have not read it thoroughly but lo and behold it begins with a discussion of seborrheic psoriasis as a strongly correlated symptom, suggesting fungal linkages. Not only do i suffer from this (I originally attributed it to UV damage to skin tissue), this was, now that i reflect back, one of the first of my symptoms to appear, long before anyone would have imagined PD! (Dermatologists should be coached to spot this‚Ä¶)\xa0 And Robin‚Äôs thoughts on prionization are also quite apt. Remember the pathogen in Creutzfeld Jacob aka mad cow‚Ä¶ is a prion.\xa0 The resemblances to auto-immune disorders are also tempting. My interest in all this, naturally, is simply to understand, and thereby somehow STOP what is happening to ME. I find Ibuprophen 200mg at bedtime to be useful (speaks to inflammation as a factor; Also I think nighttime muscle cramps have some inflammatory roots‚Ä¶) I too have been a lot better since joining a gym a few weeks ago ‚Äì and I started on Russ‚Äôs butyric acid two days ago.

There‚Äôs a lot of chicken and egg in this story. I feel better since resuming resistance training at the gym, but only when I began to feel better did i even think i was capable of going to the gym again. Definitely a psych factor(s) is/are at play here. So how does ‚Äúpositive attitude‚Äù get expressed bio-chemically? I‚Äôd love to know the answer to that one.

Sinemet also must transit the intestine and the blood-brain barrier using exactly the same carrier system as the amino acids.\nMost meals contain a large amount of protein, and the amino acids use up all the ‚Äúcarriers.‚Äù The Sinemet must wait until the carriers are free again, in order to cross over into the bloodstream. The same thing happens when Sinemet tries to get to the brain, where it does its work. Once more, amino acids clog all the ‚Äúcarriers‚Äù and Sinemet can‚Äôt get through to the brain.\nTherefore, it‚Äôs best to take Sinemet 30 to 60 minutes before eating a meal.

Here is a description of my own emotional reactions:\nI gradually became aware that sometimes when speaking to a group or a Sunday School class, my voice and throat would suddenly and unexpectedly choke up with emotion, even though I didn‚Äôt feel emotional otherwise. I eventually noted that the choking up seemed to be connected to ideas and events that I felt strongly about or that involved successes where ‚Äúthe good guys won.‚Äù For example, when I gave a PowerPoint presentation to prospective customers about the company, I got choked up slightly when I covered the many awards I had helped my company to achieve. It meant a lot to me. The company VP liked this ‚Äúsign of deep concern,‚Äù so he invited me to several sales presentations to prospective clients. This was in 2008 or so, and the choking and emotion were not overly intrusive.\nAs time went on, the emotional impacts increased. I began to notice that when something ‚Äúgood‚Äù happened on a TV drama, such as when the hero wins or when the villain is exposed, I would start to sob for about 20 or 30 seconds.\nNow, when I talk or read aloud, quite uninvited, all of a sudden, I will choke up and have to stop talking, because I cannot be understood, so firmly does the emotion choke off my voice.\nThe reaction is unpredictable. Recently my wife and I were watching a biography of economist Walter Williams. The narrator mentioned that Walter was highly influenced by Friedrich Hayek. I started sobbing uncontrollably and the crying lasted for over a minute. My wife was surprised and confused. She didn‚Äôt know how to console me. After I regained my composure, I explained that Friedrich Hayek was one of my brother‚Äôs favorite economists. Before he became ill, my brother earned a degree in economics and was fond of talking about Hayek and his theories regularly. After my brother succumbed to schizophrenia, I took care of him for many years as he suffered horribly, afraid of assassins, poisoning, bomb attacks, thieves supposedly stealing his ideas, and so on. The unexpected mention of Walter Williams and his interest in Friedrich Hayek brought a rush of memory to me about my brother and how his life, career, and accomplishments were destroyed by his disease. The emotions swept over me and I sobbed.\nNeedless to say, when this outburst of emotion, half crying, choking, and so on arrives in the middle of my conversation to strangers, and even to acquaintances, I feel like a fool. I want to say, ‚ÄúHey, I‚Äôm not really that worked up about putting Christmas lights on the eaves of the house, it‚Äôs just my Parkinson‚Äôs brain that thought the idea was extremely moving.‚Äù But as I said, the reaction stops me from talking. If I try to talk anyway, my words emerge distorted and drenched with what appears to be uncontrollable sorrow. I usually make a strong effort to stifle down the emotion, but most of the time I simply have to be silent for a minute or two.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nRobert,\nDo you find these emotions to be a hinderance?

I was known for controlling my emotions and keeping my head in professional situations when others were losing theirs. The last two years I‚Äôve been staying home because I laugh or cry at the simplest things, sometimes uncontrollably. Going out to the movies is especially bad.\nMy first symptom was a cogwheel tremor in my left arm when I was 40. After an auto accident from a blackout seizure, a physical therapist found it. I had never noticed it and didn‚Äôt even know what it was. About 1 year before that accident I had to pull over on the side of the road as I couldn‚Äôt move the left side of my body.\nThen small tremors started, intestinal issues, crying spells, seizures and falls. I was forced to retire as I could no longer drive or type, as my left arm shook uncontrollably, but only when typing. Then my gait changed and I had to use a walker at 55. I did a lot of physical therapy and was able to eventually stop using walking aids.\nThe whole time I was seeing a neurologist along with multiple other doctors. It wasn‚Äôt until my current neurologist asked me to walk across the room and saw me walk without an arm swing that she diagnosed PD.\nI was shocked and angry, but I accepted it when I realized it explained why I was having hallucinations, losing my singing voice and my talking voice got hoarse and stopped.\nNow I‚Äôm on a dopamine agonist which has controlled the hallucinations and tremors. My gait is still extremely slow and I have extreme osteoporosis so I‚Äôm really trying hard not to fall. I was first diagnosed with bone loss when I had that accident which seemed at the start of my PD. I‚Äôm 62 now so that would be 20+ years since my first symptoms.

For years, he had been running a machine to place product on upper shelves. He began feeling anxious and woozy about using this machine. He was noticing his arm strength, especially on his left side, would give out on him. \xa0 Then, after bending over one night to flush the toilet, he fell right back and passed out. He jumped right back up, walked into the bedroom and passed out again, hitting his head on the floor again. After an OH diagnosis, I began an internet search, along with one of Roy‚Äôs sons, as we didn‚Äôt know much about it. Individually, we ended up researching PD. We both came to the conclusion that Roy was experiencing many symptoms of PD. \xa0He had the left side weakness, leg cramps, head forward gait, slight drag on the left leg, quiet voice volume, shaking when using heavier tools, lack of a smile, and arms (esp. the left) that stay stationary when walking. He also had dreams that were so real to him that he would yell, punch, grab and even fall out of bed while he re-enacted his dream in our bed. These had been going on for 15+ years. His son and I then began asking his PPC to look at PD and he referred us to a wonderful neurologist that diagnosed him. \xa0The whole process of diagnosis took 4 years because a bout with cancer of the tonsil took front seat for about 2 years.\n'], ['\nRoy,\nThat sounds like a terrifying journey.

If you have ever had that sensation that one or more of your pills didn‚Äôt go all the way down, and more sips of water don‚Äôt help, then this step is obvious.

Raisins are a good choice because they are low protein (and as you know, protein and levodopa just don‚Äôt play well together). Peanuts, for example, would not be a good choice because of their high protein content. Finally, the grocery store stocks little boxes of raisins in 1/2 ounce and 1 ounce sizes.

It‚Äôs a battle, because I do like food and enjoy eating ‚Äî but food doesn‚Äôt like me back. I have enough energy (most of the time) to exercise regularly and do Rock Steady Boxing. But I also have sleep problems (as do most/many people with PD) and excessive daytime fatigue, which doesn‚Äôt help my energy level at all.\n'], ['\nMarcus- do you mean that you‚Äôve gained weight since the diagnosis?\nJo- I think my Dad struggles with the same balance. He tends to eat lots of junk food (which he was fond of long before the diagnosis). Luckily, my Mom and sister are very health conscious and also come up with ways to put healthy (yet dense) food into his sights. Have you found that certain foods irritate your stomach more than others? And what are some of your favorites?\n'], ['\nHi, Mary Beth. I‚Äôm very health conscious, too, when it comes to my diet. I‚Äôm vegan, so my favorite foods may not be suitable for your dad. Foods that irritate my stomach/gut are raw garlic (or a lot of cooked garlic), raw onion (or a lot of cooked onion), and anything that‚Äôs really high in fiber (as that slows my digestion down to a near halt). I love vegan ice cream (it feels so soothing on my very dry throat), but it‚Äôs not a health food, so I try to limit how much I have of it, though I do have a little bit almost every day. In terms of soothing foods, I like mashed potatoes (with vegan butter), tomato soup (made with V-8 juice) with rice or rice noodles in it, pasta (especially with vegan pesto), rice with cooked veggies and tofu and a sauce, nuts/seeds (pistachios, almond, cashews, sunflower seeds) and nut or seed butter (such as peanut butter, almond butter, and tahini), hummus and crackers, canned beans, well-cooked kale leaves and other dark leafy greens. Raw foods tend to be harder for me to digest, so I limit those or have very tender raw items (such as butter lettuce), which seem to agree with me better (and go down more easily). Higher-fat foods for me typically are the nuts/seeds and their butters, vegan butter, vegan mayo, and vegan ice cream ‚Äî but these must be eaten with discretion because fat can interfere with medication uptake and also slows digestion. Every day and every meal is a bit of a juggling act.\n'], ['\nI have not lost weight, but gained. Not too much, and it seems to have stabilized.  I gained about five lbs, but I attribute it to nervous/depression eating as I adjust my life living with Parkinsons symptoms.  After six years of no apparent progression, I now feel clumsy as my fingers move awkwardly like fat sausages, making fine motion impossible, and handwriting poor. I don‚Äôt so much walk anymore but lumber along being careful of my balance. \nI would say go for that ice cream.  Why hold back when you NEED the calories and enjoy it. \n'], ['\nHi, Jacque! Thanks! I do indulge ‚Ä¶ I just don‚Äôt want to fill up on ice cream in lieu of other more nutritious foods, especially because I have a limited appetite and get full very quickly.\n'], ['\nJo ‚Äì it sounds like you have a very balanced and nutritious diet. I think I could convince my Dad to eat many of those things. And my little sister airs on the side of vegan so she‚Äôd probably love it too. I know for sure that he loves ice cream. I doubt he‚Äôd notice if there were no cream in the ice cream üôÇ\n\xa0\n'], ['\nJacque ‚Äì have you found that the things you like has changed since being diagnosed?\n'], ['\nThanks, Mary Beth! Let me know if you make any headway with your dad with any of the foods I mentioned. It‚Äôs cool that your little sister is leaning toward vegan!\n'], ['\nThanks Jo! I will. I can also say that he underwent DBS last Fall. And since the surgery he put on 20lbs, which everyone was a little relieved about. So, his tendency is to drop weight but something about the surgery helped him stabilize.\n'], ['\nHi Marybeth, I had the same experience with my weight before DBS surgery. \xa0I was never\xa0overweight, 5‚Äô4‚Äù and about 125 lbs give or take a few, \xa0but always carried an extra few pounds in the thighs and places I could never loose, but then after years of struggling with PD, and always having to exert so much more energy to do anything, my body started to use it‚Äôs stored fat for energy, melting away pounds, my weight was dropping to 110 and below, which\xa0I hadn‚Äôt been in over 30 greasy. Then 3 years ago I had DBS surgery, and my doctors did not stress the possible effect it could have on my eating habits and weight gain. \xa0After about 6 months, at my doctors visit, I had already started putting on weight, I asked what was going on, the surgery had changed how my brain perceived hunger, I never felt satisfied when eating, my food intake increased, I craved sweets and ate more. I‚Äôm not sure if the doctors had stressed this side effect if it could have helped,being aware from the beginning, I‚Äôve put on an excessive \xa0amount of weight that I don‚Äôt ever think I‚Äôll loose, just something else to deal with.\n'], ['\nI have lost about 20-30 pounds off of a 180 lb. frame (only 5‚Ä≤ 8‚Ä≥). Actually, I‚Äôm very happy about the weight loss ‚Äì I‚Äôm staying at the 150 lb. level, which is much healthier for me. I had some concern that, as I came down in weight, it seemed that it would never stop, but stop it did. When I asked my neurologist his thoughts on why I was losing weight, he attributed the majority of it to my dyskinesia ! And he may be right. Apparently, it takes a fair amount of calories to ‚Äúbob & weave‚Äù all day long. But I‚Äôll take the quirks of dyskenesia any day of the week over the horrible ‚Äúoff‚Äù periods that I can encounter if my Rytary doesn‚Äôt work properly.\nBe well,\nSteve\n'], ['\nLaura,\nhas the weight gain been an unwanted side-effect for you? In my Dad‚Äôs case, he was looking really skinny before the surgery. So, I felt quite relieved to know that he gained some weight. But I‚Äôm wondering if it‚Äôll eventually stabilize or return to how he was before the surgery.\n'], ['\nSteven,\nI‚Äôve wondered why weight loss happens in PD, too. And dyskinesia does seem like the most probable cause. Do you feel strong and healthy despite the changes in weight?\n'], ['\nMarybeth, no my gain is excess of what I would have wanted, it seems to have leveled off now, but the extra weight remains and can‚Äôt see ,losing it.\n'], ['\nLaura, that sounds like a frustrating side effect. Have you discussed that symptom with your neurologist at all?\n'], ['\nIn high school, I was a macho meanie. Six feet one, and intimidating everyone by hulking around at 179 pounds. Okay, the macho part is a lie, as was meanie, intimidating, and hulking. Actually, if you think about a 179 pounds hanging off a 6-foor frame,\xa0 you will more than likely think, ‚Äústring bean‚Äù instead of ‚Äúnightclub bouncer.‚Äù Then I went to college and graduate school and got some jobs and finally ended up at 220 pounds, somewhere in the 1980s. Many years after that, I stabilized at about 199 pounds, and went through two careers at about that weight. Then, in just the last, maybe, six months or so, I\xa0 have been losing weight. Earlier this week, I was down to 182.\xa0 My levodopa and rasagiline doses are the same (have been for several years). The only things that have changed are the addition of a Neupro patch and the addition of magnesium citrate and docusate sodium, both designed to improve the waste elimination of processed food. For me, they add some help, but are not the greatest thing since bacon-wrapped filet mignon.\nSpeaking of bacon, I have a dilemma to submit to you. My weight loss has my wife worried. And I mean worried.\xa0Usually I get three or four slices of bacon once a year. In this past week, she has made me two bacon sandwiches of six slices each. She has cooked beef, and dropped that fake hamburger stuff. And tofu‚Äìyou know, those little white pencil erasers‚Äìhas disappeared from the menu. I mean, Paradise has seemingly arrived early. Corned beef hash, which used to be contraband in our house, can now strut around and smirk, just before I dump it into the frying pan. My wife allows all this and more because, she says, I need to gain weight.\nBut\xa0 here is my dilemma. I just weighed myself and I am now crushing the floor at 186, up four pounds in a week. If I tell her, will she toss the bacon and put a lock back on the hash? We haven‚Äôt discussed what my ideal weight should be, so I‚Äôm rather skittish about bringing up the subject.\nSo, that‚Äôs my tale. I don‚Äôt know what exactly is\xa0 causing me to drop pounds, but I suspect it might be the intestinal fortitude meds.\n'], ['Posts']]"

I had told everyone close to me how stress and anxiety makes my symptoms so much worse and that I need to pace myself. I have a difficult time finding words to express myself and need people to be patient. I have learned to monitor myself and know when I have had my limit of stimulation and need to retreat before I become anxious. I have expressed it a number of times but some people find it difficult to understand and pressure me. I love these people and it‚Äôs not that they arn‚Äôt supportive in other ways but the frustration I feel at my inability to do the things I used to and the way I used to do them is bad enough but when others chime in wanting me to do this or that my frustration, stress and anxiety goes over the top. I have shared videos and printed information regarding PD so they would have a better sense of what it is like for me. I get overwhelmed easily with too many people hitting me with too many things at once. Does anyone else have this issue and how do you handle it?\n'], ['\nHi Toni. I can relate very well to your post above. You have expressed this very well. I too find I have to pace myself. \xa0Too much stimulation over a few days will result in exhaustion and my brain becoming non-functional and unable to think. It is as if I‚Äôve used up all my supply of dopamine and need to retreat for up to 5 days to produce enough dopamine to recover my thinking ability. This is very restrictive and debilitating. Fortunately my family and friends seem to accept \xa0when I say ‚ÄúNo‚Äù to further activity (although I do wonder if they think I‚Äôm just being lazy). I find that over stimulation does seem to exacerbate symptoms such as fatigue, stress and tremors. Even catching up with friends and having conversations seems to deplete the dopamine and tire the brain afterwards. This is how I view it anyway.\nI‚Äôm sorry your family and friends try to encourage you to participate when you feel you‚Äôve reached your limit. No doubt they mean well but I think it must be difficult for anyone to understand how the brain has its limitations when there is insufficient dopamine for it to function fully.

Especially as I‚Äôm so much slower these days. However I do enjoy my social activities with friends but do have to limit them. Thank goodness I am retired and not still trying to go to work as well.

I think we can use humor to fight (?) or tolerate this disease. Therefore,\xa0 I will post some items that I hope will bring at least a smile to the faces of my fellow Parkies. No offense is intended. If you don‚Äôt like the humor, stop reading and go to another posting.]\nThree Things I Would Tell Someone\nWho Was Recently Diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease\nBob Harris, August 24, 2016\n1. Everyone experiences the disease differently. Let me use myself as an example. As of now, I‚Äôve had Parkinson‚Äôs for about fifteen years. My first symptom was that I seemed to have misplaced my sense of smell. Then I noticed that the buttons on the cuffs of my dress shirts had begun to conspire against me and my right hand and were making it nearly impossible for me to push them through the buttonholes. Then my handwriting became illegible. Oh, that was‚Äîand is‚Äîa huge frustration. My mind continues to generate ideas at random intervals, but after I attempt to write them down, I can‚Äôt read what I wrote. Another brilliant concept lost to humanity, forever! Or at least a list of what I need at Walmart. But I digress. The point is that while my right hand is becoming less and less of a team player, I still don‚Äôt have any tremors in my hands. Other PD folks might have the opposite situation.\nTo continue. After my nose went on strike and my hand began to write in Sanskrit or something, things seemed more or less to stabilize for many years. Okay, it‚Äôs true that eventually all the other buttons on my dress shirts joined their comrades on the cuffs and began to resist mightily my efforts to push them through the buttonholes. Sometimes it takes me ten minutes to put on or take off a button-up shirt.\nOnce again, you probably won‚Äôt have exactly these same experiences. Your right hand might remain as useful as ever. But there will most likely be something odd happening to your body that will seem strange. A few of the more common developments (and I have them all) include these:\nA. Being told that you are very soft spoken. Now, I know it‚Äôs tempting in a society like ours, where everything bad is someone else‚Äôs fault, just to tell those folks to turn up their hearing aids. However, not only is that impolite, but it doesn‚Äôt go over well when the person remarking on your soft spokenness is only ten years old and doesn‚Äôt even know what a hearing aid is.\nB. Being told that your face is expressionless. Blunt affect, someone told me. I‚Äôm always tempted to scrunch my face into a psycho killer expression, and say, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre next!‚Äù but then, I don‚Äôt want to be invited downtown where I can spend a little time in a room with mattresses on the walls.\nC. Experiencing balance issues. Some people with PD have difficulty with their sense of balance. I, for example, often stand with a slight stoop to help maintain by balance. And while the stoop does keep from stepping backwards and from falling over backwards, it does quickly give me a backache. (That, by the way, is what they mean when they say life is a series of trade-offs.)\nAgain, your experience may not be like mine. You may go for many years experiencing only minor symptoms. As they say, your mileage may vary. So, if you‚Äôre just starting down the road, remember that you are embarking on your own personal life adventure. Just as travelers on the same itinerary visit the same locations but have different experiences, so too you‚Äôll have some of the same complications but you will handle them differently.\n2. Remember that you are not your body. One of the dismaying things about Parkinson‚Äôs is that you‚Äîthe you who lives inside of your body‚Äîwill probably be watching your body become more and more uncooperative as time goes on. You‚Äôll start to wonder why your legs grow increasingly rebellious when you want to get out of a chair or put your undies on. And don‚Äôt even ask me about getting out of a bathtub. But it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs not following your commands. There‚Äôs nothing wrong with you.\nAnd it‚Äôs possible that one day you‚Äôll be leaning over a nice salad or taco mix, stirring it up really well, when all of a sudden a stream of drool will land in whatever you‚Äôre doing. Your first reaction will be surprise. ‚ÄúDid I just drool in the salad?‚Äù you‚Äôll ask, astonished. The answer is, No, you didn‚Äôt. Your body, suffering from Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, did.\nEventually, you‚ÄîI mean, your body‚Äîmight start walking with small, shuffling, oddly flopping steps that make you self-conscious and, to be frank, embarrassed. But it‚Äôs your body that‚Äôs embarrassing you. It‚Äôs not you. Your body is a temporary habitat you live in. You are not your body. And remember: we get new bodies in heaven.\n3. You and the Lord need to open a lemonade stand. Parkinson‚Äôs is something of a lemon, all right. But with God‚Äôs help, you can persevere and even flourish through your illness. It‚Äôs the sweetness of your response to personal challenges that turns lemon juice into very tasty lemonade. What better way, what better reason to bring your heart and mind and soul closer to God? People are watching to see how faithfully you respond to the burden that has come upon you. So don‚Äôt throw lemons at them, offer them some lemonade.\nIn the short story ‚ÄúYouth,‚Äù by Joseph Conrad, the character Young Marlowe faces a series of increasingly disastrous events: the ship catches on fire, the captain goes mad, the ship blows up. Each time, Young Marlowe says, in effect, ‚ÄúThis is great! I can handle this! I feel so alive! I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs going to happen next!‚Äù His attitude should be ours.\nOr as the apostle Paul would put it, ‚ÄúI can do all things through Him who strengthens me‚Äù (Philippians 4:13, NASB).\nI‚Äôll let our Partner in the lemonade business sum up for us: ‚ÄúI have told you all this so that you may have peace in Me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world‚Äù (John 16:33, NLT).\n'], ['\nTen Things Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Has Taught Me\nBob Harris \uf074 July 13, 2016, revised March 16, 2020\nYes, Parkinson‚Äôs Disease has taught me many valuable facts, about myself and others. Indeed, a Parky can see the world and others in it in a totally unique way (and that‚Äôs not just because we are stooped over when we stand or walk). Anyway, here are some things I‚Äôve learned, courtesy of having PD.\n10. I‚Äôm on the way to becoming irresistible to women.\nThey say women are attracted to men who are tall, dark, handsome, and soft spoken. Everyone keeps asking me to speak louder. And when an attractive young woman looks at me and says, ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù I understand that to mean that she is quickly growing romantically interested in me because I‚Äôm being so polite as not to yell or whistle at her. (Leave that to the construction workers.) . After all, why else would she pretend not to hear what I said, when she‚Äôs only three feet away? That must mean I am indeed soft spoken. And that‚Äôs already one-fourth of irresistibility. All I need now is elevator shoes, hair dye, and a little plastic surgery. Then again, I guess I‚Äôll pass, because I‚Äôm already happily married. (And she regularly says, ‚ÄúHuh?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù, ‚ÄúSay that again,‚Äù ‚ÄúSay that over,‚Äù and so forth. How she must love me!)\n9. Even with a blunted affect, I still can‚Äôt play poker.\nA blank facial expression might be good for poker, but for me, it makes people think I‚Äôm uninterested or bored, when the fact is, at best, I‚Äôm quite interested and at worst, I‚Äôm usually only thinking. And I don‚Äôt even know how to play poker. I just have the same poker face all the time. Except when I laugh. I need to laugh more often. Oh, another thing I‚Äôve learned from having PD is that many things have several names. (Have you ever read a Russian novel, where each character has at least three names?) ‚ÄúBlunted affect‚Äù is also known as ‚Äúmasked face,‚Äù ‚Äúfacial masking,‚Äù and by professionals, ‚Äúhypomimia.‚Äù Developing this symptom of PD can be somewhat unsettling when the Parky learns unexpectedly that he or she has it. ‚ÄúHave you met Bob?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot formally. He always looks completely bored.‚Äù ‚ÄúOh, I think he always looks angry.‚Äù ‚ÄúI wish he knew how to smile.‚Äù\n8. I am not my body.\nThe person I‚Äôm talking about when I use the word I is not the same as my decrepitating body. I have to live inside it, and let me say it used to be a much more fun and comfortable home than it is today. Not only is the house showing wear from 65 plus years of weather and neglect, but Dr. Parkinson has come in and is in the process of smashing up the place. But I‚Äôm still sitting by a warm fire in spite of a drafty house.\nTo change metaphors, my body is a car and I am the driver. The car is an older model, so that today, the radiator leaks, the engine isn‚Äôt running on all eight anymore, and the tires are going flat, but the driver is still fine. The driver just can‚Äôt go as fast as he used to. Sometimes he can barely get out of the driveway.\n7. Feeling frustrated doesn‚Äôt make anything better.\nYou know, it‚Äôs kind of aggravating when my mind tells my legs to lift me up and all they can say is, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs above my pay grade. Let the arms do it.‚Äù I tell my legs that they are very muscled, but they say, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it to ya?‚Äù And that chronic back pain; that gets old after a while. And then there‚Äôs my diminishing ability to use my beloved tools. My right hand is getting increasingly uncooperative, so now I can‚Äôt seem to make a pair of pliers do what I used to do with them. And the left hand has to help the right hand just to screw in a light bulb. But getting upset over all this doesn‚Äôt make a difference, so why bother to get upset? Besides, not many people like a grump. (And let me tell you a bizarre truth. Some of the antiparkinsonian drugs can cause compulsive behavior, such as eating all the time, gambling‚Äîand shopping. That‚Äôs me, the shopper king. For a long while, I soothed my compulsion by regular visits to the dollar store. But I‚Äôve noticed that as time goes on, I have the irresistible urge to buy tools, just as my ability to use them diminishes. I refuse to tell you how many screwdrivers I have.)\n6. I don‚Äôt take anything for granted.\nMy handwriting is already comical. Maybe I‚Äôm writing in secret code and I just don‚Äôt know it. I dare you to try to decipher it. But how much longer will I be able to type, even with my clumsy, disobedient fingers that insist on leaving out some letters and doubling others‚Äîeven in the same word. But I can still type, sort of‚Äîif you don‚Äôt mind three g‚Äôs in every word and maybe an extra f or two. (You can surmise how much editing I have to do on everything I type). But the amount I can still do is a blessing. And then there are those rebellious buttons that fight me every buttonhole. True, they no longer cooperate the way they did years ago, but, eventually, I can still button a shirt. This, too, is a blessing. In fact, I see every good thing as a distinct blessing, and not as an entitlement. Life is good‚Äîincreasingly awkward, but good. Whether I eat a 99-cent taco or a prime steak, I‚Äôm content‚Äîno, make that happy. Grateful and happy. Some people take their health for granted. Big mistake. Next time you‚Äôre glum, just sit down and count your blessings. Let‚Äôs see, safe water supply, sewer system, reliable electricity, cell phones, bubblegum, paved streets, ‚Äúwarehouse‚Äù stores, green olives, first-world medical care, the beauty of nature, potato chips, air conditioning, and on and on. Your life stinks? You have hot and cold water, available on tap, soap, washrags, shampoo, towels, clean clothes. . . .\n5. I have a lot more compassion for the handicapped.\nI‚Äôve learned that we shouldn‚Äôt judge others by using ourselves as the standard of measure. We can‚Äôt fully understand what others are going through unless we ourselves have the same situation. I feel as if I‚Äôve been put into a body that doesn‚Äôt belong to me. I ask, ‚ÄúWhy is my body stumbling around?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy does my tongue stumble, too?‚Äù and ‚ÄúWhy is my handwriting so small? Is there a paper shortage only my hand knows about?‚Äù Or is my body being my friend, knowing that my handwriting is illegible, so might as well make it small. It serves no purpose other than to fool the speaker into thinking I‚Äôm taking notes. And Yes, I feel awkward and conspicuous when I walk around. Slight stoop, uneven small steps. Now I know how other people feel who aren‚Äôt young and agile and ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù God bless them. So, less judgment, more empathy.\n4. There‚Äôs no ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù here.\nWhen something bad happens to some people, they ask, ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù when the real question is, ‚ÄúWhy not me?‚Äù We‚Äôre told that in this world we will have tribulation. And while we‚Äôre quick to ask, ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù when we get sick or hurt ourselves, how come we never ask, ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù when we‚Äôre eating lobster on a vacation cruise or even licking an ice cream cone at home? Maybe we should all get into the habit of answering the ‚ÄúWhy me?‚Äù question with, ‚ÄúBecause you‚Äôre special,‚Äù or ‚ÄúI guess because you seemed like a good choice.‚Äù\n3. We can‚Äôt predict the future.\nSeems as if every time we expect a high fast ball, we get a low curve ball instead. Here we are, afraid of a future that probably will never come, and completely unaware of what is really going to happen. The fact is, only God can see around corners; we can barely see in a straight line. Maybe we should take the hint and trust God for our future instead of trying to outguess him. Of the 100 things you grind over with worry, angst, and insomnia, only one or two will ever be likely to happen. But all 100 will hurt you as you stress and complain over them. Remember, if fortune tellers could really predict the future, they wouldn‚Äôt have their businesses in tiny, old buildings in the not-so-glamorous areas of town. The would be living in Maui or Switzerland and playing the stock market‚Äîor currency futures.\n2. I am now more aware of my mortality, and that‚Äôs a good thing.\nDid you ever notice that when people get all worked up (courtesy of the media) and begin to panic and run around like chickens with their heads cut off, all they can do is stockpile food and weapons and toilet paper? And when you ask them what‚Äôs the worst case scenario, they say, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre all gonna die!‚Äù Yep, we‚Äôre all gonna die. They are absolutely right. But we knew that already. We just haven‚Äôt been thinking about it that much. And until or unless the Lord calls our attention to it in a quite personal way we won‚Äôt get a clue. But when you get a NOTICE of COMING DEATH, you have the opportunity to do some planning and thinking, and communing with your maker. Gonna die. Check. Got it. Getting ready.\n1. I still have hope.\nI was at a meeting a little while back when someone asked me, ‚ÄúHow can you have hope, knowing that you suffer from a terminal disease?‚Äù My first answer was, ‚ÄúLife is a terminal disease.‚Äù But the better answer is that I have hope in God, who made me, owns me, and can unplug me whenever he wants. Learning to trust God, and to place your hope in him, might require a lengthy effort, but once you get there, you can find joy in any circumstance. So, I have hope‚Äînot that I will be cured, but hope for the kingdom of God. And hope for strength during the remainder of my stay here. It is said that instead of asking God to remove the mountain in front of us, we should ask him to teach us to climb mountains. And in the meantime, put our hope in the peace and rest we‚Äôll find at the top.\nThe Bible is a good place to find out about our hope. Isaiah tells us:\nDo not fear for I am with you;\ndo not be afraid, for I am your God.\nI will strengthen you; I will help you;\nI will hold onto you with My righteous right hand.\n‚ÄîIsaiah 41:10 (HCSB)\n'], ['\nMy Name Is Bob, and I Don‚Äôt Have Parkinson‚Äôs\nBob Harris March 16, 2020\nSo they look at me and notice some things about me and say, ‚ÄúYou have Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù\nTo which I say, ‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt have Parkinson‚Äôs Disease.‚Äù\nAnd they say, ‚ÄúThen why do you take little shuffling steps and sometimes freeze and can‚Äôt decide which foot to step out with next?‚Äù\nAnd I reply, ‚ÄúOh, I understand your confusion. My legs have Parkinson‚Äôs. That makes them often uncooperative. I don‚Äôt like it when they shuffle like that, but what can I do?‚Äù\nSo they say, ‚ÄúWell, if you don‚Äôt have Parkinson‚Äôs, then why do you sometimes slur your speech and drool and talk too fast and so softly that people can barely hear you?‚Äù\nAnd I answer, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you see? All those effects are the result of my mouth having Parkinson‚Äôs. I keep telling it not to slur or talk too fast or too softly, but it just doesn‚Äôt pay attention. I just have a disobedient mouth. That‚Äôs common in mouths with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease. Uncooperative to the core.‚Äù\nSo they say, ‚ÄúOh, I get it. I suppose the reason you no longer have a sense of smell is not because you have Parkinson‚Äôs, but because your nose has Parkinson‚Äôs; and the reason you have tiny, unreadable handwriting is not because you have Parkinson‚Äôs, but because your hand has Parkinson‚Äôs.‚Äù\nAnd I say, ‚ÄúYes, you‚Äôre catching on. Now you understand when I say that I don‚Äôt have Parkinson‚Äôs.‚Äù\nAnd they say, ‚ÄúThen what‚Äôs wrong with you?‚Äù\nAnd I say, ‚ÄúNothing is wrong with me. After all, I‚Äôm still me. I‚Äôm not my body. I‚Äôm Bob.‚Äù\n‚ÄúThat is why we never give up. Our physical body is becoming older and weaker, but our spirit inside us is made new every day. ‚Äù\xa0 ‚Äî2 Corinthians 4:16\n'], ['\nMy Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is Not Progressing\nBob Harris, Original: August 22, 2017, update, March 16, 2020\nThey have it all wrong. In fact, they‚Äôve got it backwards. And I find that positively retropulsive. (Did you get that joke? Huh? Huh? Retropulsion is the fancy term for those little backward steps some of us Parkies take, to prevent us from falling over backwards.)\nSorry for the pun on retropulsion and repulsive, but this terminology zoo we are in is positively confusing. (Or is it negatively confusing?)\nFor example: It‚Äôs one thing for me to notice that I‚Äôve become a bit more unstable on my feet, or that I‚Äôm beginning to slur or stutter occasionally, or that my muscle control is lessening a bit. But when I‚Äôm told that this means that my disease is progressing, it gives me a headache.\nI mean, look up the word progress in the dictionary. ‚ÄúProgress: gradual improvement, betterment, moving forward, ascension, advance, enhancement.‚Äù Enhancement? This describes my physical diminishment? In that case, then, eventually I will likely be enhanced so much that I won‚Äôt be able to move.\nWouldn‚Äôt it be better for me to choose a word instead that indicates a decline or loss or worsening? What about decrepitating? You know, like that old car you kept too long? I could say, ‚ÄúMy Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is decrepitating‚Äù?\nOr how about, dilapidating? Like that old gas station that between thieves, kids, and the weather, gradually just fell apart. Imagine working as a Walmart greeter.\n‚ÄúWelcome to Walmart. How are you today?‚Äù\n‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm still dilapidating. Thanks for asking. How goes it with you?‚Äù\nMaybe declivitating is the right term. Picture this:\n‚ÄúWelcome to Denny‚Äôs. How many guests?‚Äù\n‚ÄúTwo non-smoking and one declivitating, please.‚Äù\nI mean, let‚Äôs be realistic and use the right words. Saying that our Parkinson‚Äôs is progressing makes it sound as if it‚Äôs going to conquer us. And we won‚Äôt let it do that.\nWe trust the Lord that the best part of life is ahead, because we get new bodies in heaven, and they will obey our commands. They‚Äôll walk easily, speak clearly, and feel full of energy. That confident hope sustains us, no matter how much our disease ‚Äúprogresses.‚Äù\n‚ÄúBehold, I tell you a mystery; we will not all sleep, but we will all be changed. For this perishable must put on the imperishable, and this mortal must put on immortality.‚Äù\n‚Äî1 Corinthians 15:51, 53\n‚ÄúIn the world you have tribulation, but take courage; I have overcome the world.‚Äù\n‚ÄîJohn 16:33b\n'], ['\nBob, you‚Äôre awesome ‚Äì thanks for sharing all of these posts!!

Big smiles, big laughs!\nMara E\n\xa0\n'], ['\nAll your posts have been a delight to read.\xa0 Some great insights and ideas to ponder!!!\n'], ['\nGot Pills?\nBob Harris, March 17, 2020\nScene 1\nMy father, who was a medical doctor in his prime about seventy years ago, used to say about someone he found utterly distasteful, ‚ÄúHe is just a pill,‚Äù or ‚ÄúThat woman is a pill.‚Äù I use the word ‚Äúdistasteful‚Äù intentionally. Many pills in those days were just stamped out of powdered ingredients and sold uncoated to the hapless public. Needless to say, they weren‚Äôt exactly crafted for taste. Yes, pills tasted horrible, no matter how quickly you tried to swallow them. (If you want to share the experience of patients of yesteryear, next time you\xa0 have a headache or an aching back, take two uncoated aspirin, like the ones you can get from the dollar store, and chew them up before you swallow. Mm mm, good.) So when my father said, ‚ÄúThat last patient was a real pill,‚Äù listeners could nod in knowing agreement. They knew bitter as a reality, not just a metaphor.\n\xa0\nScene 2\nBut you know, in those days it wasn‚Äôt so bad. First, in the old days, when someone had a headache, they were often prescribed the inhaling of coffee vapors. In the era after that, if you had, say, a bullet wound, you were offered a stiff slug of whiskey and the soft lead end of a bullet to grit between your teeth (hence the expression, ‚Äúbite the bullet‚Äù). After that, when aspirin became available, it was sold in powder form. You had to be really sick in order to want to run a mouthful of that stuff across your palate. Still, that was a leap forward for the medical profession, and soon coffee aromas and lead-and-whiskey applications were forgotten. So the availability of the drug in pill form was considered a major advance. Think of how many billions of APCs (aspirin, phenacetin, caffeine) were consumed by the military (until the 1960s, when phenacetin was banned because it can cause kidney disease and cancer).\n\xa0\nScene\xa0 3\nIn my fifties, I worked as an instructional designer for the call center of a mail order pharmacy, where I created training materials for the customer service representatives. Since our reps were mostly in their twenties, we knew that visuals were important to keep their attention. So I scoured the Internet for stock photo companies, looking for just the right pictures that would make an impact. Since exaggeration is a significant method of gaining attention, I looked for images with hyperbolic content, making a point by going way beyond reality. One of the images\xa0 I found showed an older man peering from slightly behind a stack of eight or nine pill bottles. He looked concerned, befuddled, overwhelmed. ‚ÄúWhat could all these pills do? How can this poor man keep them straight?‚Äù I thought. ‚ÄúWhat a great satire on modern medicine! Inflate the situation to make a point.‚Äù We used that slide to discuss topics such as drug interactions, pill-taking difficulties, missing medication times, and so on.\n\xa0\nScene 4\nNow that I‚Äôm pushing up against seventy, I have to admit that the photo of the man buried behind a mass of pill bottles is not actually satire, after all. It is a picture of reality. And rather than exaggeration, it is an understatement. Indeed, I have become that man in the photo. For I have not eight or nine, but twelve or thirteen bottles‚Äîof pills, capsules, gelcaps, tablets. I‚Äôve got dopamine, stuff that pretends it‚Äôs dopamine, stuff that makes dopamine work stronger, stuff that makes dopamine last longer. And that‚Äôs just the Parky meds, unless you want to add the stool softener, needed because all the other meds and Parkinson‚Äôs itself constipate the heck out of many of us. (Do I recommend the stool softener? It works great. Instead of feeling as if\xa0 you‚Äôre passing chunks of concrete, it‚Äôs just feels like passing hardened asphalt rubble.)\nSo what? Well, my pill regimen requires that I take various pills five times a day. So who has time to eat? And who has an appetite anyway? It‚Äôs almost a good weight loss program, except that I can‚Äôt chew the pills, depriving me of chewing satisfaction. At least the pills that would otherwise be horribly distasteful are coated now.\nIn an effort to reduce the whole pill-taking nightmare, the pharmaceutical industry has begun to explore other routes of administration. Instead of (or in addition to) swallowing, you can now take your medicine by inhaling, injecting, pumping, or infusing it transdermally (that is, by skin patch).\nAt any rate, we have come a long way from those days when the doctor‚Äôs assistant said, ‚ÄúAnesthetic, did you say? Sure. Here, drink some of this whisky and then bite down on this bullet. I‚Äôll have your leg sawn off in no time. And if your stump doesn‚Äôt get infected or cause unendurable pain, and if you don‚Äôt bleed to death, you‚Äôll be fine‚Äîeventually.‚Äù\nMaybe the meds we have are not so bad after all.\n\xa0\n‚ÄúChrist gives me the strength to face anything.‚Äù\xa0 ‚ÄîPhilippians 4:13 (CEV)\n'], ['\nHi Robert, thank you for the wonderfully descriptive words to describe the ‚Äòprogression‚Äô of this most un-progressive disease! I imagine your sense of humour helps you cope.\nI coped with the changes my body threw at me for the first few years with ‚ÄòdeParkinial‚Äô, it didn‚Äôt make the symptoms disappear , but I told myself the symptoms \xa0were figments of my imagination, because, as you pointed out, you are still you, it‚Äôs just the body that has moving or shaking problems.\nDo you have a word for the times that occur only rarely; when the planets are aligned, the meds are working, you‚Äôve been able to sleep for more than four hours and there is no immediate stress looming; that you have a glorious hour or two so immersed in something that ‚Äì for a while ‚Äì you \xa0feel like you did ‚Äì before PD?\n\xa0\n'], ['\nRobert\nWhat a word picture.\xa0 concrete ‚Ä¶.asphalt rubble.\nI can identify.\nGood job.\nRobert C.\n'], ['Posts']]"

230,Constipation Treatments,https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/forums/forums/topic/constipation-treatments/,['9'],['13'],"[['Posts'], ['\n\nConstipation seems to be a very common problem for Parkies, apparently due to the lack of proper bowel muscle operation (dopamine affects every muscle) and/or due to a side effect of one or more medicines.\nSo, what can you do to remedy this chronic condition? The solution has to be long term and not harmful, so a regular double dose of those extreme blow-out laxative products isn‚Äôt a good answer. Here is what I have done and/or am doing now. Be sure to consult your neurologist before implementing any of these regimens. From mildest to most dramatic, they are\n1. Drink more water and juice and fluids. Parkies are known for being slightl dehydrated, and water is needed to process the former food.\n2. Eat more fiber and drink high-fiberf juice. Prunes and prune juice are obvious choices, but apples, bananas, avocados, peanuts and other natural foods are great sources. Eat fiber bars. Some of them have up to 9 grams of fiber per bar. Be warned, however, many of the bars are spiked with chicory root, which tends to cause bloating and gas. Eat one of those bars for breakfast and you might clear out your whole office before noon. Wheat bran is also recommended by food folks, and psyllium is too. I like prunes (which have now been rehabilitated by calling them ‚Äúdried plums‚Äù) and peanuts and avocados, and apples. Don‚Äôt overdo it, though. Too much fiber can cause‚Äìwait for it‚Äìconstipation. The recommended amounts of fiber that I see on reputable web sites is 38 grams per day for men under 50, 30 grams per day for men over 50. For women under 50, 25 grams per day; for women over 50, 21 grams per day.\n2. Take 1 to 2 stool softener pills per day. The stool softener is docusate sodium and comes in 100 mg gel caps. The directions on most bottles say you can take up to 3 pills (300 mg total) per day. I take one pill per day, at my 6 am medicine feast.\n3. Magnesium is also recommended for Parkies with constipation, because it also helps treat magnesium deficiency, which can cause restless legs and fidgeting. There are several forms available: Magnesium gluconate, and magnesium citrate can supply a laxative effect. Recommended dose per day is 400 mg.\n4. The Nuclear Option: Consult your neurologist of doctor before resorting to the nuclear option. Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve learned from experience. (I guess having Parkinson‚Äôs means never having to say you‚Äôre embarrassed.) I buy those 4.5 ounce saline enema bottles from the dollar store or anywhere, and POUR OUT THE CONTENTS. Then I fill the little bottle with warm tap water, put some hand soap on the nozzle to lube it, and go for it. In about five minutes I usually have the desired results. On rare occasions, when one bottle is insufficient, I refill the bottle and bomb my bum twice. Beware, with the second load of water, results are almost always immediate. I have used this treatment for at least a year and have had no untoward effects. And I‚Äôm not injecting drugs, only tap water. When my constipation has driven me to feel sad, bloated, out of sorts, sluggish, lazy, and tired, I pursue the nuclear option and half an hour later I feel rejuvenated (as much as a Parky can feel rejuvenated).\n'], ['\nThe only thing that has worked for me fairly consistently is taking Miralax every day (with my doc‚Äôs approval). From what I‚Äôve read, this is a common solution for PWP (and a good way to avoid the nuclear option). üôÇ I also take magnesium citrate before bed and also try to drink plenty of water and clear fluids during the day. It‚Äôs not perfect, but this combo has worked better for me than others I‚Äôve tried. Prune juice, fiber-rich foods, fiber supplements, etc. have been both inconsistent and unreliable.\n'], ['\nHi,\nThank you for this topic. I also have a big problem with constipation. I always drink extra water, eat lots of fiber, take magnesium 150 high absorption 2 times a day, senokot stool softner, restoraLax (suggested by my neuro) and glycerine suppositories when necessary. However, I can and I do have bowel movements with this regime.  The issue I have is that I spend a great amount of time in the bathroom whether I go or don‚Äôt go. Strain or don‚Äôt strain. I spend an amazing amount of time in the bathroom either way.  I find I wake up between 3-5 am most every morning because of bowel pressure.  My average time in the bathroom is 45 minutes but at times I wait over an hour. The rest of my day is similar.  I‚Äôm sorry to be so graphic but I havn‚Äôt read anything very specific on this topic.  Most of us just say constipated but like all of PD symptoms each of us can experience something odd or different.  I don‚Äôt know if anyone can relate to what I mean and if others have this kind of bowel issue. My massage therapist has suggested stomach massage that she says can be very helpful.  I will be trying it soon and will come back to this post if I find it helpful.\n'], ['\nMy personal record in the constipation department was 2 weeks with no action. \xa0Miralax, Dulcolax tablets, \xa0Magnesium Citrate‚Ä¶nothing worked. I eat plenty of fiber. I exercise. I thought I was getting adequate fluids because my urine was usually very pale/clear. Then one day I realized that a large proportion of fluid intake was caffeinated. Caffeine can pull the water from your gut and put it into your urine instead. Voila! That makes nice dilute urine and stools like cement! I got a ‚ÄúWater‚Äù app on my phone and started tracking my water intake. Not as impressive as I‚Äôd thought. I set my target for 72oz per day and within 2 weeks my bowel function improved markedly. My MDS told me she wanted me to have 3 movements a week, and now most weeks I am there! I know this is not the perfect solution for everyone, because PD slows down the movement of your gut itself. However, for many PwPs that are new to this game, actually tracking your water intake and improving it may surprise you.\n'], ['\nFor about 3 months I had mild, intermittent abdominal pain and no appetite for an evening meal.\xa0 Eventually the abdominal pain increased to the point that I went to an ED and, after an abdominal CT, was diagnosed with constipation.\xa0 I had been taking oxybutynin (oxy) to calm my urinary bladder to decrease nocturia and apparently the oxy was contributing to constipation by reducing bowel peristalsis.\xa0 I stopped the oxy and started taking 1.5 doses of Miralax and three 500 mg Citrucel tablets each day.\xa0 (I use the generic versions of each.) I keep a BM diary to track the approximate amount of stool that I am passing each day.\xa0 (Usually I just estimate, but I do have a strainer and scale that I use occasionally to check my estimates.)\xa0 If I pass less than 10 oz of stool per day for 3 days (or if I have symptoms like abdominal pain or loss of appetite) then I take one extra dose of Miralax, one extra Citrucel tablet and 17 mg of sennakot before bed for one or two days. I have been using this regimen for about 9 months.\xa0 Seems to work for me.\n'], ['\nMy hubby has also suffered with constipation issues. He has finally found a regiment that works for him, so I‚Äôll share it in hopes it helps others. First, water is of utmost importance. We live in Florida, so staying hydrated is a must. Adding in the constipation issue just adds to the mix. Next, a piece of fruit with each meal, at least, per day. Add a cup of Smooth Move tea each evening. Two 30 minute walks each day, for more reasons than just the constipation. A half cup of unsalted, mixed nuts each day. A Docusate (stool softener) each day, as prescribed by his neurologist. It took a couple years to find the right amount of food/meds to make for regular, fairly quick, and painless bowel movements. Previous to that, it took up to a whole 24 hour day to pass ‚Äúthe plug‚Äù that then allowed enormous amounts of stool to follow. We hope that this may help someone that is still struggling with constipation.\n'], ['\nI didn‚Äôt realize that constipation could be linked to PD. Thank you for sharing your experiences.

So, I know that his digestive process is difficult but it doesn‚Äôt quite function the same way as it used to.\n'], ['\nMary Beth,\nHydration is a great place to start, because it has to be a part of ANY constipation treatment regime. \xa0Traditionally, good bowel function is made up of fiber, fluids and exercise. It‚Äôs sort of like a three-legged stool: do without one of these and the whole thing falls over. For some PwPs, having a properly balanced 3-legged stool is all it takes. For others, various other things must be added ‚Äì and the right routine is as varied as each individual PwP. But first start with the easy stuff. Water is cheap. Exercise is good for many aspects of PD. Fiber can be deliciously added to a diet plan. \xa0Cheap, easy, doesn‚Äôt interfere with any of the meds.

It‚Äôs been interesting how small purchases like shower seat with handles, toilet seat bidets, bed rails, canes, altered clothes so you can dress, shoes you can get on with help of 3 foot shoe horn, massage, physio therapy, etc. can all add up quickly. These things were not part of our original budget. The idea of nursing care or assisted living scares me financially as well as emotionally.\nYes, prior to diagnosis we did have a plan.  We were very much wanting to spend a year living in Europe.  It had been a dream of ours. Unfortunately it will not be possible.  I wish it was just delayed but we know we can not do it so need to change plans.

I think that Pharma are only looking at therapies that will make them rich. This slows down the way to a cure or a much better therapy. I suspect that the cause for some Parkinson‚Äôs disease in some cases is as simple as a having inadequate or incorrect bacteria in one‚Äôs digestive tract. There may be a very inexpensive therapy/treatment to solve this problem, however, the United States government and many other states, place many restrictions on its use and Pharma does little to study it, because they know it won‚Äôt yield a big return on investment. The therapy I‚Äôm writing about may also have positive benefits for sufferers of depression and anxiety, obesity\n'], ['\nMatt, I am with you on big Pharma.\xa0 They have no incentive to find a cure and lose their revenue stream.\xa0 \xa0I do believe there may be\xa0 a connection to bacteria in the gut and also have read some promising research about lack of blood to dopamine producing neurons of the brain.\xa0 Here is a youtube video (a bit dry, but well worth watching)\xa0\xa0https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&v=iEO9MwWCPQ0\n'], ['\nJean. Thanks for your reply. I will check out the YouTube link soon As I‚Äôm done here. I also wanted to mention that Pharma is not the only stumbling block. The doctors themselves make great investments to get into the profession. Such people tend to be conservative in their thoughts and actions. And the practice of medicine in itself, under the control, as it is in America, of large corporate interests, tends to further reinforce that tendency. These are not a people nor is it a system that that is conducive to ‚Äúout of the box‚Äù thinking. I should add that I have some experience in this area apart from being a patient. I come from a family with many doctors.

It is quite interesting to me because I have been suffering from a hypersensitivity to mold for most of my life, and I have had the great misfortune to have been exposed to excessive levels of it for much of that time. Someone who I consider the foremost expert in the field, Dr. Richie Shoemaker, believes that people like me can end up with a chronic inflammatory condition from such exposure, one of the symptoms of which is hypoperfusion, a condition of insufficient oxygen in the body‚Äôs tissues! Meanwhile, researchers at the company that is the subject of the video contend that the death of the dopaminergic neurons in the Parkinson sufferers brain is the result of hypoperfusion. What an interesting coincidence! Dr. Shoemaker has been saying that Parkinson-like symptoms can result from the chronic inflammatory condition that he is focused on. And even more importantly, there are drugs available now to treat that hypoperfusion. If I wasn‚Äôt so financially challenged, I would‚Äôve pursued this long ago, but that may change for the better very soon.\n'], ['\nThere are so many schools of thought regarding causes of PD.\xa0 I do believe it may be related to inflammation, issues with the gut and the angiogenesis theory makes sense to me.\xa0 \xa0 If in fact Zhitttaya is on to something with angiogenesis, the potential to improve the lives of so many that have\xa0 so many ‚Äúincurable diseases‚Äù\xa0 is huge.\xa0 \xa0I think their challenge will be going against Pharma which has a LOT to lose if these diseases are cured.\xa0 \xa0If you havent signed up for Zhittiata‚Äôs email list, I highly recommend it.\xa0 \xa0I have gotten several very informative emails from them over the past month or so..\n'], ['\nMatt & Jean ‚Äì Great discussion so far. My father suffered from Parkinson‚Äôs about the last nine or ten years of his life. My father was an extremely healthy person, but when he turned 72, he started showing signs of early onset Parkinson‚Äôs. After he retired, my father wanted to get another job and he went to work for a chemical company. As he worked for the company, he noticed that quite a few of his friends that he‚Äôd been working with were having to go on disability because they were showing signs of Parkinson‚Äôs. My brother is not a doctor, but he is extremely smart when it comes to different diseases. He read me an article that he found years and years ago where researchers were starting to correlate Parkinson‚Äôs disease with people who worked for chemical companies. This study concluded that after inhaling fumes from certain chemicals, this may trigger the Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms. I‚Äôll ask him more about this today when I talk to him and I will also do some research on the Internet to try and find this article.\n'], ['\nI firmly believe some of us may be more prone to PD and that something triggers the onset.\xa0 In my case, I believe it was the emotional trauma I suffered after the suicide of my soul mate.\xa0 I have 2 friends with PD, one had a difficult child birth and the other was attacked and beaten up about the head, both physical traumas.\xa0 \xa0In others, it could be a toxic substance, or family history.\nYet, if someone is not prone to PD, they may be able to experience major physical or emotional trauma (or exposure to toxic substances) and never suffer with PD.\xa0 Not unlike the person who smokes 5 packs a day and never gets lung cancer, yet someone who may be exposed to just a small amount of second hand smoke and gets lung cancer.\n'], ['\nExcellent points. I‚Äôm definitely not an expert on Parkinson‚Äôs disease, I just know what my father went through and some of the trials that he had. Parkinson‚Äôs made it difficult for my father to walk, and he also experienced hand tremors, but it never did affect his head. The last couple of years that my father was with me, his speech began to become difficult to understand, but I personally think that some of that was caused by some of the depression that he was going through.

Did you start feeling this type of tremor early or did it seem to develop later?\n'], ['\nMary Beth It started about 3 years ago. I‚Äôve figured out that I first started having PD symptoms about 22 years ago. I was diagnosed in 2019 after they really got bad and I started \xa0meds which have helped immensely.\nI had horrible migraines and sinus headaches my whole life. I blacked out and fell ever since I was a kid but the drs said my headaches had nothing to do with it. Ice pick headaches deep in the middle of my head and through the temples as well as cluster headaches started 6 years ago followed by 3 retinal detachments. My doctors said they had nothing to do with it, although I had massive pain behind my eyes each time they happened.\nThe ‚Äúboot to the back of the head‚Äù headaches started 4 years ago, about the same time the ‚Äúrag doll‚Äù shaking did. I suspected something was going on with my motor control.\nThe ‚Äúsledgehammer on the top of my head‚Äù headaches happened right before I was diagnosed with PD. I went to the ER as I thought I might be having a stroke since it runs in my family. My blood pressure ‚Äúwent through the roof‚Äù they told me, which was weird as I‚Äôve always had 80/60.\nSo I‚Äôve come to the conclusion, at least in my case, that the headaches are a sign of a problem with the ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù in my brain. I‚Äôve always had a long list of medical issues following these headaches my whole life, which I think are really just symptoms and a smaller part of the larger problem, an issue with my brain wiring or something like that.\nMy drs have never really figured out my blackouts and falls since I was young, like age 5 at least. They thought I had polio back then. So maybe PD is somehow part of a genetic thing too, since my dad had ‚Äúthe shakes‚Äù as it‚Äôs called in my family.\nMichael, my mom had some kind of mental problem we thought because she was verbally abusive. I‚Äôm the only one that she physically abused, dragging me down the hall by my hair and slamming my head on the ceramic sink in the bathroom. She said she hated washing my long hair which my dad liked. Drs have told me that‚Äôs enough to have caused trauma to my brain, so I think it may be a part of it. I‚Äôm not the only one with headaches in my family though.\nI first noticed the shakes with my dad when he was about 40. He used to get so emotional, like angry and cry, that I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with him. When he was about 70 he started shaking, falling and whatever else and they thought he had ALS. They sent him to Cleveland Clinic and did a nerve biopsy but never figured out what was wrong with him.\nIt turns out though that I was diagnosed with Myasthenia Gravis last year so maybe he had that instead of, or in addition to PD, like me. It‚Äôs an autoimmune MD disease. My older sister has the same emotional rages like my dad did and falls a lot, and she has autoimmune rheumatic arthritis.\nSo I really think a long burn PD condition that‚Äôs familial like mine is possible too, not just like M Fox has, which was pronounced from the start. My dad and me both started having symptoms around 40, and it didn‚Äôt get bad until 20+ years later. I don‚Äôt know when my sister‚Äôs symptoms started but she had rheumatoid in her teens. She‚Äôs been so emotional the last few years she refuses to talk to anyone in our family, which adds to the stress. \xa0This condition has definitely taken a toll on our family.\nMy son, who is now 40, first noticed a twitch in one of his eyes in his 20s. I‚Äôve had the same twitch since my 20s. So I think it‚Äôs definitely a slow burn in some families, not just the rapid decline like M Fox had. I‚Äôve never heard anything about his family so I wonder about that. Does anyone here know about that?\n'], ['\nTina, Thank You for sharing your experience here on this forum, as it‚Äôs one more story that puts PD in perspective and helps some of us see the condition in a new light.

I‚Äôve figured out that I first started having PD symptoms about 22 years ago. I was diagnosed in 2019 after they really got bad and I started \xa0meds which have helped immensely.\nI had horrible migraines and sinus headaches my whole life. I blacked out and fell ever since I was a kid but the drs said my headaches had nothing to do with it. Ice pick headaches deep in the middle of my head and through the temples as well as cluster headaches started 6 years ago followed by 3 retinal detachments. My doctors said they had nothing to do with it, although I had massive pain behind my eyes each time they happened.\nThe ‚Äúboot to the back of the head‚Äù headaches started 4 years ago, about the same time the ‚Äúrag doll‚Äù shaking did. I suspected something was going on with my motor control.\nThe ‚Äúsledgehammer on the top of my head‚Äù headaches happened right before I was diagnosed with PD. I went to the ER as I thought I might be having a stroke since it runs in my family. My blood pressure ‚Äúwent through the roof‚Äù they told me, which was weird as I‚Äôve always had 80/60.\nSo I‚Äôve come to the conclusion, at least in my case, that the headaches are a sign of a problem with the ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù in my brain. I‚Äôve always had a long list of medical issues following these headaches my whole life, which I think are really just symptoms and a smaller part of the larger problem, an issue with my brain wiring or something like that.\nMy drs have never really figured out my blackouts and falls since I was young, like age 5 at least. They thought I had polio back then. So maybe PD is somehow part of a genetic thing too, since my dad had ‚Äúthe shakes‚Äù as it‚Äôs called in my family.\nMichael, my mom had some kind of mental problem we thought because she was verbally abusive. I‚Äôm the only one that she physically abused, dragging me down the hall by my hair and slamming my head on the ceramic sink in the bathroom. She said she hated washing my long hair which my dad liked. Drs have told me that‚Äôs enough to have caused trauma to my brain, so I think it may be a part of it. I‚Äôm not the only one with headaches in my family though.\nI first noticed the shakes with my dad when he was about 40. He used to get so emotional, like angry and cry, that I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with him. When he was about 70 he started shaking, falling and whatever else and they thought he had ALS. They sent him to Cleveland Clinic and did a nerve biopsy but never figured out what was wrong with him.\nIt turns out though that I was diagnosed with Myasthenia Gravis last year so maybe he had that instead of, or in addition to PD, like me. It‚Äôs an autoimmune MD disease. My older sister has the same emotional rages like my dad did and falls a lot, and she has autoimmune rheumatic arthritis.\nSo I really think a long burn PD condition that‚Äôs familial like mine is possible too, not just like M Fox has, which was pronounced from the start. My dad and me both started having symptoms around 40, and it didn‚Äôt get bad until 20+ years later. I don‚Äôt know when my sister‚Äôs symptoms started but she had rheumatoid in her teens. She‚Äôs been so emotional the last few years she refuses to talk to anyone in our family, which adds to the stress. \xa0This condition has definitely taken a toll on our family.\nMy son, who is now 40, first noticed a twitch in one of his eyes in his 20s. I‚Äôve had the same twitch since my 20s. So I think it‚Äôs definitely a slow burn in some families, not just the rapid decline like M Fox had. I‚Äôve never heard anything about his family so I wonder about that.

I‚Äôve figured out that I first started having PD symptoms about 22 years ago. I was diagnosed in 2019 after they really got bad and I started \xa0meds which have helped immensely.\nI had horrible migraines and sinus headaches my whole life. I blacked out and fell ever since I was a kid but the drs said my headaches had nothing to do with it. Ice pick headaches deep in the middle of my head and through the temples as well as cluster headaches started 6 years ago followed by 3 retinal detachments. My doctors said they had nothing to do with it, although I had massive pain behind my eyes each time they happened.\nThe ‚Äúboot to the back of the head‚Äù headaches started 4 years ago, about the same time the ‚Äúrag doll‚Äù shaking did. I suspected something was going on with my motor control.\nThe ‚Äúsledgehammer on the top of my head‚Äù headaches happened right before I was diagnosed with PD. I went to the ER as I thought I might be having a stroke since it runs in my family. My blood pressure ‚Äúwent through the roof‚Äù they told me, which was weird as I‚Äôve always had 80/60.\nSo I‚Äôve come to the conclusion, at least in my case, that the headaches are a sign of a problem with the ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù in my brain. I‚Äôve always had a long list of medical issues following these headaches my whole life, which I think are really just symptoms and a smaller part of the larger problem, an issue with my brain wiring or something like that.\nMy drs have never really figured out my blackouts and falls since I was young, like age 5 at least. They thought I had polio back then. So maybe PD is somehow part of a genetic thing too, since my dad had ‚Äúthe shakes‚Äù as it‚Äôs called in my family.\nMichael, my mom had some kind of mental problem we thought because she was verbally abusive. I‚Äôm the only one that she physically abused, dragging me down the hall by my hair and slamming my head on the ceramic sink in the bathroom. She said she hated washing my long hair which my dad liked. Drs have told me that‚Äôs enough to have caused trauma to my brain, so I think it may be a part of it. I‚Äôm not the only one with headaches in my family though.\nI first noticed the shakes with my dad when he was about 40. He used to get so emotional, like angry and cry, that I didn‚Äôt know what was going on with him. When he was about 70 he started shaking, falling and whatever else and they thought he had ALS. They sent him to Cleveland Clinic and did a nerve biopsy but never figured out what was wrong with him.\nIt turns out though that I was diagnosed with Myasthenia Gravis last year so maybe he had that instead of, or in addition to PD, like me. It‚Äôs an autoimmune MD disease. My older sister has the same emotional rages like my dad did and falls a lot, and she has autoimmune rheumatic arthritis.\nSo I really think a long burn PD condition that‚Äôs familial like mine is possible too, not just like M Fox has, which was pronounced from the start. My dad and me both started having symptoms around 40, and it didn‚Äôt get bad until 20+ years later. I don‚Äôt know when my sister‚Äôs symptoms started but she had rheumatoid in her teens. She‚Äôs been so emotional the last few years she refuses to talk to anyone in our family, which adds to the stress. \xa0This condition has definitely taken a toll on our family.\nMy son, who is now 40, first noticed a twitch in one of his eyes in his 20s. I‚Äôve had the same twitch since my 20s. So I think it‚Äôs definitely a slow burn in some families, not just the rapid decline like M Fox had.

I was always exploring new activities. I finally had to admit this year that I had stopped engaging and recently set goals. I learned to sew at age 5 and had businesses. My eyes and back made it difficult to sit in front of my machine so I gave it up and sold everything.\nI decided recently to buy a new machine for myself as I always said I was going to do for my retired life. Even though I‚Äôve had it two weeks and haven‚Äôt read the manual or threaded it yet, I did set it on my table and bought material to make a baby quilt for my first grandchild. I‚Äôve made them for lots of kids and I thought it would be a terrible waste of talent if I didn‚Äôt make her one. So my next goal is to make a very simple one before she‚Äôs born at the end of April.\nI don‚Äôt know if I can really make myself do it, but my daughter had made quilts with me since she was little and I was thinking maybe she would help me.\nI‚Äôm ashamed of myself for my declining motivation and yet glad I‚Äôve taken the steps I have to get started. Since I couldn‚Äôt make my way through the airport by myself yesterday, I know I should be proud of myself for not giving up entirely.\nThese conditions I have are not friendly to me, but I‚Äôm trying to stand my personal ground to the greatest degree for as long as I can. I refuse to stay sad for any unreasonable amount of time. I‚Äôve always been a positive minded person and plan to stay \xa0so. \xa0I just turned 62 yesterday and am very happy I made it to that age cognitively alert, as that‚Äôs been a long term goal for the last 20 years.\nI‚Äôm also glad I found this forum at the recommendation of my RN home visit, since I get out about twice a month now and it‚Äôs a long time between the monthly local PD group. I don‚Äôt like sharing the level of what I‚Äôm going through with my friends, neighbors, family etc yet. So I‚Äôm really grateful for this forum and hope my wordiness doesn‚Äôt drive other PD people nuts. I‚Äôll keep you posted on the quilt progress if that‚Äôs ok.\nSince this page is supposed to be about voice and I found that website for the singing practice, that‚Äôs going to be a new hobby for me too.

The part about moving the foot in circles astonished me that this is related to PD. For me it was my left arm. I thought I had a stroke because I could not figure out how to move it in the direction I wanted.\nHaving been an athlete in many different sports, I just couldn‚Äôt understand how it could of happened, which started about 2 years after an auto accident and a lupus flare. It was also the same time I lost the volume in my voice, which I attributed to being pushed against the steering wheel. The accident happened when I had a seizure and lost consciousness while driving.\nI spent more than 5 years retraining that arm myself with no specific diagnosis or physical therapy, but I did accomplish it to a useful point. To this day though I have to apply thought to that arm before I use it as the tremors are worse there, especially when I‚Äôm anxious or meds are wearing off. I can‚Äôt trust that arm to hold objects at any time by itself.\nMy volume has decreased over the years, and my pitch has been limited this year. Hoarseness has been developing since the accident. Since a few months ago I have been humming or singing just a few words or phrases of a verse, but it‚Äôs painful. My neurologist says this is really from the MG as I have trouble swallowing as well. She tested for the antibodies which came up positive, so I‚Äôm on meds for that, but it hasn‚Äôt helped the voice so far.\nYour other point about the bucket list hits home with me. Since I‚Äôve worked through the initial 5 stages of grief for my former life, I have a renewed appreciation for my life now and what I‚Äôm able to presently do, so I‚Äôm quickly taking advantage of it.\nI think this condition makes for a heightened awareness of existence, at least of the steps. Looking back I can see it‚Äôs been a 20 year journey, of which I didn‚Äôt realize where I was really going. \xa0There is comfort in knowing that others can relate; it brings some solace in being able to put a label on some unanswered questions.\nNow that everyone around me, including strangers, can see I have difficulty with things, has become more of a stress reliever for me. I‚Äôve hidden my difficulties from everyone over the last 20 years, even myself sometimes, I think, for many reasons, including my career.\nAccepting assistance and allowing myself the freedom of just existing sometimes, living in the present and being thankful for what I have to enjoy, is my new reality. I‚Äôve always been a very religious person as well, and relied on prayer and meditation with God to help me deal with my issues privately. Especially in the beginning when doctors weren‚Äôt so supportive without more definitive answers, but on a more timely basis now.\nThis is a condition that calls for reflection, acceptance, and action. It‚Äôs preparatory and impetus for living life to the fullest, which is really a good recipe for everyone.

Even sinemet or its generic equivalents can have this effect.  I‚Äôm no neurologist, but from what I‚Äôve read, dopamine is a motivational component of reward-motivated behavior. The anticipation of most types of rewards increases the level of dopamine in the brain. So we‚Äùre flooding our brains with artificial dopamine, which perhaps has an effect on our desire levels; if normally you have been able to control your desires for certain foods, now with this artificial dopamine flowing, the desires are more than you can handle.\nEating junk food is relatively harmless unless it gets completely out of hand, but there have been cases where PD victims have lost everything on gambling sprees or have had their marrriages break up over infidelity, and especially the agonists have been shown to be responsible for this.\nAs for the sock hole problem, do you keep your toenails short ;-)?\n\n\n\t\tThis reply was modified 6 months ago by Lou Hevly.\n\t\n\n'], ['\nTina ‚Äì it‚Äôs interesting you say that.

Mine started last year, which was my second PD year. It was localised to the middle point between the last two toes (4<sup>th</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup>, the smallest ones). My family doctor saw no association with my PD and sent me to see a neurologist different to the one that sees me for PD. The neurologist carried out an EMG (Electromyography) and the diagnosis was ‚Äúdiscreet signs of pain on the peripheral motoneuron. Not recent and of radicular type at the EDB (extensor digitorum brevis: this is a muscle of the upper surface or dorsum of the foot)) and on the right tibial muscle). In human parlance: sensible damage on muscles of the lower leg, just below the knees, affecting capillary nerves below the toes.\nAs the pains were easing out, I asked my family doctor not to give me any new medicine. I had fears that any new medicine would worsen the side effects of Sinemet. Indeed, the problem disappeared shortly afterwards.\nNow, two weeks ago the problem started again and it affected a bigger area: all inter-toe gaps and up on the instep. I saw my family doctor yesterday and he prescribed Gabapentin 300mg. (Mylan Generics). He checked that there would not be a clash with Sinemet. I got the medicine and on reading the first warning I decided not to take it. It said that in case of feeling a pain on the upper part of the stomach it was necessary to seek immediate medical attention because that could be a shock of acute pancreatitis. As I already had an episode of acute pancreatitis, I am well aware of the high risk of sudden death (3 out of 100 patients). So, the only relief I get is by immersing my feet in cold water for 5 or 10 minutes and that gives me a couple of hours of sound sleep; always with my feet uncovered. Last night I applied something simpler: I laid a piece of plastic besides my bed and placed a folded wet towel on top. When the pains waked me out I put my feet on the wet towel and folded it to cover also my instep. Thus, I avoided the nuisance of going to the bathroom to submerge my feet.

One time in particular occasioned me to have my wife drive me to the ER at 6 am, and for me that signals a very serious situation.\n   Here are some of the remedies and supplements I have used to help my insomnia:\nFor sleep, I tried MANY supplements, exercises, etc. and currently use the following for sleep:\n1. I take ‚ÄúCalm‚Äù by Natural Vitality. This was developed by Peter Gilliam and later sold to Natural Vitality in Texas. I buy it from Vitacost at below retail. This helps with sleep, AND with constipation. (it‚Äôs the magnesium) If elimination slows down, I just take an extra teaspoon at dinner, then my regular heaping teaspoon in hot water before bed.\n2. I found that with PD, the same, repeated supplement-cocktail would only work once, ie. that ‚ÄúParky‚Äù would negate it if repeated‚Ä¶so‚Ä¶I alternate between my best two cocktails every other night, and that has proven the best. Besides Calm, I take: B1, B5, Tryptophan, Valerian root, melatonin in varied amounts of each. I substitute the amounts of Valerian and Tryptophan every other night, 3 of one, 1 of the other.\n3. I try to avoid strenuous exercise, and sources of light (computer screens, TV, cell phone screens) before bed, but I do do stretching for my lower back, and I do ‚ÄúJumper Cabling‚Äù as taught by Howard Shifke at: https://www.fightingparkinsonsdrugfree.com/ \n4. I wake up several times each night to use the restroom, and after 5 a.m. I put on a sleeping mask like Desi and Lucy used to wear on the Lucy Show on TV. This helps avoid morning light. I also use room darkening shades and keep the bedroom as dark as possible.\n5. I also do dexterity and nerve exercises before getting out of bed, then do jogging and strength exercises each day.\n6. ASEA water has also helped my insomnia. For researching for PD, I use Health Unlocked also. I found it by researching ASEA water for PD. It was one of the many sites where I found ASEA mentioned by people who had tried it. In fact, the testimonial(s) I found about ASEA on Health Unlocked helped me decide to try it. It did help. In that it‚Äôs pricey, I became a distributor to help defray my cost, and to help my friends try it at my cost.\n     It‚Äôs backed-up by some pretty sound science, and I found many friends, some with MAJOR medical conditions who were using it with stellar success. Part of that science is that dealing with cellular level healing takes some time (like the time it takes for major illnesses like PD to manifest), so using it for the long term is the best bet as I see it because it helps the body heal on a cellular level. I‚Äôve been using it at my current dosage since 28mar19.\nIf you‚Äôre interested, there is a short video explaining the basic cellular tech at: https://vimeo.com/64465323\nAnd my web-site for ASEA is at: https://1800242709.myasealive.com/  Here one can find success stories of people using ASEA and info on distributorships.

Fatty acids are the building blocks of fats that our cells need to function. Butyrate is made when the bacteria living in our guts ferment otherwise indigestible fibers from grains, beans, onions, bananas, and other foods rich in complex carbs.\nButyrate is the preferred energy source for the cells in your colon wall. It is essential for maintaining a healthy barrier between the colon and bloodstream and it prevents inflammation in the gut.\nProponents:\n‚Ä¢Is a major energy source for colon cells\n‚Ä¢Believed to help prevent colon cancer\n‚Ä¢Increases mitochondrial activity\n‚Ä¢Prevents toxins from crossing the gut barrier\n‚Ä¢Improves insulin sensitivity\n‚Ä¢Promotes healthy weight\n‚Ä¢Fight inflammation\n‚Ä¢Prevents the growth of pathogenic bacteria\n‚Ä¢Protects the brain\nSkeptics:\n‚Ä¢Strong odor\n‚Ä¢Lack of high-quality human research\n‚Ä¢Difficult to separate butyrate from other short-chain fatty acids\n1) Gut Health\nButyrate is essential for maintaining a healthy environment in the gut. In the human colon, anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum, Roseburia intestinalis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ferment carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs): acetate, propionate, and butyrate [3, 10, 11].\nColon Cell Energy Source\nButyrate nourishes the colon wall, maintains a healthy lining and barrier function of the colon, and prevents intestinal inflammation [4].\nIn the mitochondria of colon cells, 70-90% of butyrate is oxidized into acetyl-CoA, which is then used to generate large quantities of ATP, the primary form of cellular energy [12].\nIf you don‚Äôt have enough butyrate-producing bacteria in your gut, you may be more likely to develop diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and even colon cancer [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\nShort-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, can reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In one study of 13 people with Crohn‚Äôs disease, a type of IBD, butyrate supplements improved 69% of cases, with symptoms completely disappearing in 54% (seven participants) [18, 19, 20, 21].\nThere are a variety of approaches for using butyrate to manage IBD and colitis. The treatment strategies range from a high-fiber diet to butyrate-producing probiotics, coated butyrate tablets, and rectal enemas [22, 23].\nDiarrhea & Gut Inflammation\nResistant starch is a type of soluble fiber that your gut bacteria can ferment into butyrate. A diet containing lots of resistant starch improved diarrhea in a trial of 57 baby boys [24].\nButyrate can also prevent inflammation and stomach ulcers caused by alcohol. Mice given butyrate before alcohol had less inflammation and damage to the lining of their stomachs [25].\nSodium butyrate in combination with other SCFAs and silicon dioxide was also shown to benefit traveler‚Äôs diarrhea, a condition common among those who travel to exotic countries [26].\nAccording to a great many studies, butyrate is vital for healthy gut flora, controlling inflammation, and maintaining a strong intestinal barrier.\n2) Inflammation\nButyrate suppresses the activity of cells and proteins that drive inflammation [27].\nIn one study on human cells, butyrate drastically reduced the activity of interleukin-12 (IL-12), an inflammatory cytokine, while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is generally anti-inflammatory [28].\nIn mice, butyrate-producing dietary fibers counteracted inflammation and illness caused by bacterial toxins. The inflammatory cytokines inhibited by butyrate included interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon gamma (INF-y) [29].\nImmune Response\nButyrate may reduce inflammation by increasing the activity of immune cells called regulatory T cells or Tregs. These specialized cells stop other immune cells ‚Äì Th1, Th2, and Th17 ‚Äì in their tracks, before they lose control. In turn, Tregs prevent the lining of the gut from overreacting to harmless food proteins [30].\nGut Barrier\nButyrate also strengthens the barrier formed by cells in the colon wall, thus preventing microbes and bacterial toxins from invading the bloodstream [31].\nInflammation Due to Aging\nAs we grow older, inflammation increases throughout our bodies. In aging mice, a diet high in fiber that produces butyrate counteracted age-related increases in inflammation, suggesting that butyrate may be especially helpful to the elderly. Human studies will be required to confirm this benefit, however [32].\nAnimal and cell studies show that butyrate inhibits inflammatory cytokines and prevents inflammatory bacterial toxins from entering the bloodstream.\n3) Fine-Tuning the Immune System\nAs an HDAC inhibitor, butyrate adjusts the immune system in a number of ways.\nHDAC inhibitors improve the tumor-targeting abilities of immune cells like T cells and natural killer cells; they are currently under investigation as potential cancer drugs. This class of compounds also reduces many inflammatory signals and increases Tregs, a type of white blood cell that prevents allergies and autoimmunity [33, 34, 35].\nButyrate more specifically protects the gut barrier and prevents pathogens and other harmful agents from crossing into the bloodstream [36].\n4) Brain and Nerve Cells\nThe gut and the microbiome strongly affect the brain. Your gut bacteria ‚Äútalk‚Äù to your cells by releasing butyrate, which (as an HDAC inhibitor) turns on certain genes [37].\nCognition\nButyrate may improve learning and long-term memory. Similar to exercise, sodium butyrate increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice. Simply put, butyrate supplies ‚Äúbrain food‚Äù (neuro = brain, trophic = food) to the hippocampus, the brain‚Äôs hub for memory and emotions. This gives birth to new neurons, called neurogenesis, a process that can reshape the brain [38].\nThe effect of butyrate supplements or intestinal butyrate concentration on cognition has not been tested in humans. However, this effect has been repeated multiple times in animals, and probiotics containing butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with reduced stress in humans. Human trials on butyrate and cognition are likely to be next [39, 40, 32, 41].\nBrain Injury\nThere‚Äôs a huge overlap between cognitive enhancement and recovery from brain damage. Both rely on neurogenesis, a process that replenishes and reshapes the brain.\nIn a mouse study, sodium butyrate given after a stroke supported the development of new nerve cells in the damaged areas. It also strengthened the blood-brain barrier in mice with brain trauma, which helped them recover. Butyrate-producing bacteria also strengthened this barrier in mice [42, 43, 44].\nClostridium butyricum, a butyrate-producing species of bacteria, may help manage vascular dementia, a disease whereby blood vessel blockages prevent brain cells from getting enough oxygen. In a mouse study, animals with C. butyricum in the gut experienced less cell death in their brains [45].\nThese effects have not yet been investigated in human trials.\nNerve Damage\nButyrate may also help manage other types of nerve damage. In guinea pigs, sodium butyrate protected nerve cells in the ear after treatment with antibiotics, thus preventing hearing loss [46].\nMice with brain damage due to lack of oxygen fared better when they were given the butyrate-producing bacteria Clostridium butyricum before the injury [47].\nSodium butyrate also prevented the death of nerve cells in the spine of mice with spinal muscular atrophy [48].\nAnimal studies show that butyrate is neuroprotective and may improve memory and reduce the impact of brain trauma. Human trials will be needed to confirm these effects.\n Food Sources\nYou get can butyrate from food. For example, butyric acid abounds dairy products, especially butter. Butter, which gave butyrate its name, contains about 3 to 4% of butyrate in the form of tributyrin. Plant oils also contain butyrate to some extent [115, 116, 117].\nEating more fiber increases butyrate production by some bacteria in your gut. There is generally an association between a higher intake of plant foods and increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyrate, in stools. However, not all plant-based foods yield butyrate; for example, diets rich in fruit or starch are associated with high butyrate levels in the gut, but starch-free wheat bran is not [118, 119, 120, 121].\nDepending on the composition of your gut flora, the following fibers may encourage them to produce SFCAs, including butyrate [122, 123, 124]:\n‚Ä¢Inulin: artichokes, garlic, leeks, onions, and asparagus\n‚Ä¢Fructooligosaccharides (FOS): fruits and vegetables, including bananas, onions, garlic, and asparagus\n‚Ä¢Resistant starch: cooked and cooled rice, potatoes and green bananas\n‚Ä¢Pectin: apples, apricots, carrots, oranges, and others\n‚Ä¢Oat bran\n‚Ä¢Arabinoxylan\n‚Ä¢Guar gum\n‚Ä¢Arabinogalactan\n‚Ä¢Hi-Maize, potato or plantain starch flours\n'], ['\nI buy Butyrex¬Æ by T.E.Neesby online.

So as far as medical science goes, at best this is in the realm of ‚Äúguesswork‚Äù. In states where cannabis is still illegal I think a presumption can be made that most docs either know NOTHING or are hesitant to say anything (as they should be) because they don‚Äôt want to put their licenses in jeopardy. I personally have consulted with 5 different docs in two states who ‚Äúspecialize‚Äù in this, 3 appeared to be quacks and 2 appeared to me to be the real deal. This is in addition to multiple neurologists. Have also visited multiple dispensaries and talked to a lot of people.\xa0 What I learned so far (all comments are my personal observations only, do not hold up to scientific rigor) :\n1)this is NOT about getting high, which I think is a really bad idea for PD patients due to the cognitive impairment that can result.\n2) Probably best to get products from dispensary (need a card for this), as there are beneficial effects utilizing all the compounds and terpenes in the plants, which I don‚Äôt think you can get when trying to buy elsewhere. Also think products bought at dispensary probably have a more accurate profile in what you are actually ingesting.\n3)Personally I think sublingual drops are the way to go; though vaping has a quicker onset, don‚Äôt think there is enough data about the safety of inhaling anything, and given that PD patients are at a higher risk for aspiration pneumonia, don‚Äôt like the concept of adding another irritant to the airway.\n4) Cannabis products are sativa based, indica based or hybrids. Sativa is more for the head and has more psychoactive properties, indica more for the body.\xa0 There are certain terpenes in each that have different effects.\xa0 I think what we want is indica based compounds that relax the body.\n5) CBD is not psychoactive (and the trace THC found it sold by dispensaries is likely meaningless), and is probably the safest product to use though like with the rest of cannabis more studies are needed. Most of the CBD sold does not tell you whether it is indica or sativa based. However some dispensaries do. If you can find one that sells indica based CBD, I think that is the way to go to help with anxiety, tremors and insomnia. It definitely relaxes the body (subtly). It generally comes in vials\xa0 with a dropper that tell you the mg and cc in each vial. You have to do the math to dose it. I find 5-10 mg sublingual to be helpful (in most concentrations this is about half a dropper, but again need to calculate). Probably best to start very low and titrate up. Best guess is 1-3x per day is probably ok, as needed.\n6) THC products should be treated with extreme caution. I think most neuro docs would be against it because of the potential for cognitive impairment. I see no reason for a PD patient to mess with sativa based THC (really ever), which is what gets people the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù.\xa0 (Unless going to a Woodstock reunion ;weak attempt at humor).\xa0 However, indica based THC can be microdosed using a dropper that comes with the vial. 1-2 drops under the tongue at bedtime (dose is a tiny fraction of a mg) has been highly recommended\xa0 for insomnia (doesn‚Äôt get you high).\xa0 \xa0It‚Äôs all about risk: benefit imo. When weighing the potential for cognitive impairment from sleep deprivation versus the potential therapeutic effect form micro dosing indica based THC, I think the latter wins out. Personal opinion only, like the rest of what I am writing.\n7) Myrcene (a cannabis based terpine ) can be found in certain teas‚Äô and is probably helpful as well. High concentrations are found in indica based THC.\nAt any rate I will stop now.

I really didn‚Äôt want to take pharmaceuticals, but there‚Äôs really not much else available. I talked with my first doctor about it, as I knew nothing at all about medical cannabis and he really didn‚Äôt either. He said the same thing you‚Äôll hear and read everywhere: There have been no solid clinical, peer-reviewed studies and everyone‚Äôs brain is different and responds differently to medical marijuana (MM). That‚Äôs why it would be virtually impossible for your neurologist to prescribe anything. Doctors know very little about how MM works, and there are literally thousands of MM options, and they vary from state to state. There aren‚Äôt any standardized forms as there are with pharmaceuticals.\nThat said, I got my card and went to my dispensary. I‚Äôve gotten quite an education since then. I tried vaping MM, which is supposed to provide more of an instant relief. I kind of enjoyed the experience of vaping, and it seemed to provide a bit of a calming effect for me, but I have since developed a very dry mouth and throat (not from the vaping, but probably from my meds or PD in general), so vaping isn‚Äôt a good solution for me. I also tried the sublingual oils, and those didn‚Äôt have much of an effect at all, but that might have been due to their strength, the low dosage I was taking, and a bit of general fear I had of them. I had a high CBD/low THC oil for the daytime and a high THC one for nighttime. The daytime one kind of ‚Äútook the edge off‚Äù between my pills (which is what I was hoping it would do), but the nighttime one just made my mind race (and I need something to help with insomnia, fragmented sleep, and restless legs, so that didn‚Äôt help at all).\nI tried the daytime one until I ran out of it, and I recently returned to the dispensary. I‚Äôm now trying two other options (an oil for day ‚Äî 1:19 THC to CBD and another oil for night (1:1 THC to CBD). They are VERY pricey (actually all the MM products are expensive!), but I think these will work much better for me. I‚Äôm mainly using them as an adjunct to my regular PD meds, as I need something to help during ‚Äúoff‚Äù periods. However, if they helped so well that I could give up the pharmaceuticals, I‚Äôd do so in a heartbeat. Occasionally there‚Äôs a story about someone along those lines, but I think the people who get that kind of benefit from MM are few and far between.\nWhat they‚Äôve mostly helped with is calming me down and relaxing me so I‚Äôm not quite as restless and my tremor isn‚Äôt quite as active. Their effects are very subtle ‚Äî nothing drastic (at least not for me). I‚Äôm going to continue with them to see if the more I use them the more effective they will be. Note that dosage is highly individual (another reason a neurologist can‚Äôt prescribe a product or dosage). I suggest going to your dispensary and talking with the pharmacist there. They will be able to educate you about the various products available, how to use them, what might be best for you based on your symptoms, and what dosage to start with and how to tritrate up.\nMore research is being done in this area, but much more is needed. Until there is a cure (and I‚Äôm optimistic there may be one in a few years ‚Äî I‚Äôm the same age as you are, Jean!), the MM may be the best option for helping us get through this without adding more and more and more drugs to our regimens.\n'], ['\njo\nlike you, i would love to give up prescription drugs. i wonder if the pharmacist in the dispensary near me is knowledgeable.\xa0 i plan to speak with my neuro next week about this.\xa0 the thought of vaping scares the heck out of me.\xa0 when i smoked marijuana in high school, i used to laugh a lot, eat, then fall asleep.\n\xa0\ni hope u have enough optimism for me in terms of a cure in our lifetimes üôÇ\n'], ['\nHi, Jean,\nThe pharmacist at my dispensary spent a lot of time with me.

Vaping is supposed to work quickly but doesn‚Äôt last that long, whereas the sublingual oils work in about 15-30 minutes (if you can keep the oil under your tongue for 1 full minute); if you swallow the oil, it won‚Äôt have any effect for an hour or two because it will be going to your stomach rather than into your bloodstream, and whatever is in the stomach (especially if you‚Äôve eaten fatty foods) will slow down its absorption.

Note: It seems to be acceptable to take as much as 8 pills of 25/100 carbidopa/levo in 24 hour period, and my doses during waking hours are fairly low.

I find that all of the different dispensary‚Äôs in my town in Florida have slightly different products. Have started using 12.5:1 CBD to THC. The dose for anxiety is 20mg (for most concentrations this is one full dropper) sublingual. I like this best in the evening before going out or just for chilling a few hours before bed. Definitely helpful so I am somewhat relaxed when I hit the hay. I have also been struggling mightily with sleep but for the first time in eons think I may have found a solution (for me) as I have now had 3 of the best sleeps I have had in several years after getting this horrible diagnosis. Note: I have tried benzodiazepines, melatonin, antidepressants, exercise, meditation and massage all with little to no avail. So what I do is CBD as above a few hours before bed time, shut lights around 11 PM, and then when I wake at 2 am (which is always) I vape pure indica based THC. Because I can‚Äôt tolerate big ‚Äúhits‚Äù due to a sensitive airway, I take 3 small puffs‚Ä¶have done this 3x now and the result is I have slept 4-5 solid hours more. Wonder drug if this continues! AM tempted to praise the almighty.  (before trying this I would sleep from 12-2am and maybe 5-6am on average.) Don‚Äôt get high or feel euphoric, just relaxed and sleepy. Like a normal person! And the next day I feel like a new man cause I finally got some rest. So the argument against this is that there are not enough studies done to determine the potential cognitive impairment from THC over the long term. But I would argue that the cognitive impairment from chronic sleep deprivation is considerably worse, plus the amount I am ingesting is 3 very small puffs. Note: I have tried sublingual THC , don‚Äôt like it as much cause onset takes too long. Now I can say that the times I feel most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (like myself pre diagnosis) is when I exercise vigorously (which I pretty much do for multiple hours every day) and when I am able to sleep.

The benzos hang out in ur body and are cumulative. The half life of clonazepam, which seems to be the drug the neuro guys like for PD, is something like 40 hours, which means every time you take it half is still in your  body up to 2 days later! (note: others are shorter but are still quite long.) The THC I am ingesting can be considered microdosing. The 3 puffs are very small, just enough to turn the light of the disposable vape pen on for a fraction of a second, it is a minimal inhalation, and I don‚Äôt visibly blow smoke out. I never get high, 4 hours later maybe mildly groggy but it goes away , esp with physical activity. Note: As noted above, I have also microdosed the drops sublingually, which seem to hang around a bit longer, more like 6-8 hours. Add that to the delayed onset using drops and I don‚Äôt like it as much as the inhalation. Note: I am asthmatic, so also have to be careful.  Finally,  it is my opinion (solely anecdotal based on a small sample size) that most neurologists no little to nothing about cannabis, esp in states where it has been recently legalized or remains illegal. I also forgot to say that I take a dose of carbidopa/levodopa ( 25:100) in the middle of the night as well (by itself not enough to put me back to sleep.)

Fatty acids are the building blocks of fats that our cells need to function. Butyrate is made when the bacteria living in our guts ferment otherwise indigestible fibers from grains, beans, onions, bananas, and other foods rich in complex carbs.\nButyrate is the preferred energy source for the cells in your colon wall. It is essential for maintaining a healthy barrier between the colon and bloodstream and it prevents inflammation in the gut.\nProponents:\n‚Ä¢Is a major energy source for colon cells\n‚Ä¢Believed to help prevent colon cancer\n‚Ä¢Increases mitochondrial activity\n‚Ä¢Prevents toxins from crossing the gut barrier\n‚Ä¢Improves insulin sensitivity\n‚Ä¢Promotes healthy weight\n‚Ä¢Fight inflammation\n‚Ä¢Prevents the growth of pathogenic bacteria\n‚Ä¢Protects the brain\nSkeptics:\n‚Ä¢Strong odor\n‚Ä¢Lack of high-quality human research\n‚Ä¢Difficult to separate butyrate from other short-chain fatty acids\n1) Gut Health\nButyrate is essential for maintaining a healthy environment in the gut. In the human colon, anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum, Roseburia intestinalis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ferment carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs): acetate, propionate, and butyrate [3, 10, 11].\nColon Cell Energy Source\nButyrate nourishes the colon wall, maintains a healthy lining and barrier function of the colon, and prevents intestinal inflammation [4].\nIn the mitochondria of colon cells, 70-90% of butyrate is oxidized into acetyl-CoA, which is then used to generate large quantities of ATP, the primary form of cellular energy [12].\nIf you don‚Äôt have enough butyrate-producing bacteria in your gut, you may be more likely to develop diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and even colon cancer [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\nShort-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, can reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In one study of 13 people with Crohn‚Äôs disease, a type of IBD, butyrate supplements improved 69% of cases, with symptoms completely disappearing in 54% (seven participants) [18, 19, 20, 21].\nThere are a variety of approaches for using butyrate to manage IBD and colitis. The treatment strategies range from a high-fiber diet to butyrate-producing probiotics, coated butyrate tablets, and rectal enemas [22, 23].\nDiarrhea & Gut Inflammation\nResistant starch is a type of soluble fiber that your gut bacteria can ferment into butyrate. A diet containing lots of resistant starch improved diarrhea in a trial of 57 baby boys [24].\nButyrate can also prevent inflammation and stomach ulcers caused by alcohol. Mice given butyrate before alcohol had less inflammation and damage to the lining of their stomachs [25].\nSodium butyrate in combination with other SCFAs and silicon dioxide was also shown to benefit traveler‚Äôs diarrhea, a condition common among those who travel to exotic countries [26].\nAccording to a great many studies, butyrate is vital for healthy gut flora, controlling inflammation, and maintaining a strong intestinal barrier.\n2) Inflammation\nButyrate suppresses the activity of cells and proteins that drive inflammation [27].\nIn one study on human cells, butyrate drastically reduced the activity of interleukin-12 (IL-12), an inflammatory cytokine, while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is generally anti-inflammatory [28].\nIn mice, butyrate-producing dietary fibers counteracted inflammation and illness caused by bacterial toxins. The inflammatory cytokines inhibited by butyrate included interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon gamma (INF-y) [29].\nImmune Response\nButyrate may reduce inflammation by increasing the activity of immune cells called regulatory T cells or Tregs. These specialized cells stop other immune cells ‚Äì Th1, Th2, and Th17 ‚Äì in their tracks, before they lose control. In turn, Tregs prevent the lining of the gut from overreacting to harmless food proteins [30].\nGut Barrier\nButyrate also strengthens the barrier formed by cells in the colon wall, thus preventing microbes and bacterial toxins from invading the bloodstream [31].\nInflammation Due to Aging\nAs we grow older, inflammation increases throughout our bodies. In aging mice, a diet high in fiber that produces butyrate counteracted age-related increases in inflammation, suggesting that butyrate may be especially helpful to the elderly. Human studies will be required to confirm this benefit, however [32].\nAnimal and cell studies show that butyrate inhibits inflammatory cytokines and prevents inflammatory bacterial toxins from entering the bloodstream.\n3) Fine-Tuning the Immune System\nAs an HDAC inhibitor, butyrate adjusts the immune system in a number of ways.\nHDAC inhibitors improve the tumor-targeting abilities of immune cells like T cells and natural killer cells; they are currently under investigation as potential cancer drugs. This class of compounds also reduces many inflammatory signals and increases Tregs, a type of white blood cell that prevents allergies and autoimmunity [33, 34, 35].\nButyrate more specifically protects the gut barrier and prevents pathogens and other harmful agents from crossing into the bloodstream [36].\n4) Brain and Nerve Cells\nThe gut and the microbiome strongly affect the brain. Your gut bacteria ‚Äútalk‚Äù to your cells by releasing butyrate, which (as an HDAC inhibitor) turns on certain genes [37].\nCognition\nButyrate may improve learning and long-term memory. Similar to exercise, sodium butyrate increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice. Simply put, butyrate supplies ‚Äúbrain food‚Äù (neuro = brain, trophic = food) to the hippocampus, the brain‚Äôs hub for memory and emotions. This gives birth to new neurons, called neurogenesis, a process that can reshape the brain [38].\nThe effect of butyrate supplements or intestinal butyrate concentration on cognition has not been tested in humans. However, this effect has been repeated multiple times in animals, and probiotics containing butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with reduced stress in humans. Human trials on butyrate and cognition are likely to be next [39, 40, 32, 41].\nBrain Injury\nThere‚Äôs a huge overlap between cognitive enhancement and recovery from brain damage. Both rely on neurogenesis, a process that replenishes and reshapes the brain.\nIn a mouse study, sodium butyrate given after a stroke supported the development of new nerve cells in the damaged areas. It also strengthened the blood-brain barrier in mice with brain trauma, which helped them recover. Butyrate-producing bacteria also strengthened this barrier in mice [42, 43, 44].\nClostridium butyricum, a butyrate-producing species of bacteria, may help manage vascular dementia, a disease whereby blood vessel blockages prevent brain cells from getting enough oxygen. In a mouse study, animals with C. butyricum in the gut experienced less cell death in their brains [45].\nThese effects have not yet been investigated in human trials.\nNerve Damage\nButyrate may also help manage other types of nerve damage. In guinea pigs, sodium butyrate protected nerve cells in the ear after treatment with antibiotics, thus preventing hearing loss [46].\nMice with brain damage due to lack of oxygen fared better when they were given the butyrate-producing bacteria Clostridium butyricum before the injury [47].\nSodium butyrate also prevented the death of nerve cells in the spine of mice with spinal muscular atrophy [48].\nAnimal studies show that butyrate is neuroprotective and may improve memory and reduce the impact of brain trauma. Human trials will be needed to confirm these effects.\n Food Sources\nYou get can butyrate from food. For example, butyric acid abounds dairy products, especially butter. Butter, which gave butyrate its name, contains about 3 to 4% of butyrate in the form of tributyrin. Plant oils also contain butyrate to some extent [115, 116, 117].\nEating more fiber increases butyrate production by some bacteria in your gut. There is generally an association between a higher intake of plant foods and increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyrate, in stools. However, not all plant-based foods yield butyrate; for example, diets rich in fruit or starch are associated with high butyrate levels in the gut, but starch-free wheat bran is not [118, 119, 120, 121].\nDepending on the composition of your gut flora, the following fibers may encourage them to produce SFCAs, including butyrate [122, 123, 124]:\n‚Ä¢Inulin: artichokes, garlic, leeks, onions, and asparagus\n‚Ä¢Fructooligosaccharides (FOS): fruits and vegetables, including bananas, onions, garlic, and asparagus\n‚Ä¢Resistant starch: cooked and cooled rice, potatoes and green bananas\n‚Ä¢Pectin: apples, apricots, carrots, oranges, and others\n‚Ä¢Oat bran\n‚Ä¢Arabinoxylan\n‚Ä¢Guar gum\n‚Ä¢Arabinogalactan\n‚Ä¢Hi-Maize, potato or plantain starch flours\n'], ['\nI buy Butyrex¬Æ by T.E.Neesby online.

So as far as medical science goes, at best this is in the realm of ‚Äúguesswork‚Äù. In states where cannabis is still illegal I think a presumption can be made that most docs either know NOTHING or are hesitant to say anything (as they should be) because they don‚Äôt want to put their licenses in jeopardy. I personally have consulted with 5 different docs in two states who ‚Äúspecialize‚Äù in this, 3 appeared to be quacks and 2 appeared to me to be the real deal. This is in addition to multiple neurologists. Have also visited multiple dispensaries and talked to a lot of people.\xa0 What I learned so far (all comments are my personal observations only, do not hold up to scientific rigor) :\n1)this is NOT about getting high, which I think is a really bad idea for PD patients due to the cognitive impairment that can result.\n2) Probably best to get products from dispensary (need a card for this), as there are beneficial effects utilizing all the compounds and terpenes in the plants, which I don‚Äôt think you can get when trying to buy elsewhere. Also think products bought at dispensary probably have a more accurate profile in what you are actually ingesting.\n3)Personally I think sublingual drops are the way to go; though vaping has a quicker onset, don‚Äôt think there is enough data about the safety of inhaling anything, and given that PD patients are at a higher risk for aspiration pneumonia, don‚Äôt like the concept of adding another irritant to the airway.\n4) Cannabis products are sativa based, indica based or hybrids. Sativa is more for the head and has more psychoactive properties, indica more for the body.\xa0 There are certain terpenes in each that have different effects.\xa0 I think what we want is indica based compounds that relax the body.\n5) CBD is not psychoactive (and the trace THC found it sold by dispensaries is likely meaningless), and is probably the safest product to use though like with the rest of cannabis more studies are needed. Most of the CBD sold does not tell you whether it is indica or sativa based. However some dispensaries do. If you can find one that sells indica based CBD, I think that is the way to go to help with anxiety, tremors and insomnia. It definitely relaxes the body (subtly). It generally comes in vials\xa0 with a dropper that tell you the mg and cc in each vial. You have to do the math to dose it. I find 5-10 mg sublingual to be helpful (in most concentrations this is about half a dropper, but again need to calculate). Probably best to start very low and titrate up. Best guess is 1-3x per day is probably ok, as needed.\n6) THC products should be treated with extreme caution. I think most neuro docs would be against it because of the potential for cognitive impairment. I see no reason for a PD patient to mess with sativa based THC (really ever), which is what gets people the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù.\xa0 (Unless going to a Woodstock reunion ;weak attempt at humor).\xa0 However, indica based THC can be microdosed using a dropper that comes with the vial. 1-2 drops under the tongue at bedtime (dose is a tiny fraction of a mg) has been highly recommended\xa0 for insomnia (doesn‚Äôt get you high).\xa0 \xa0It‚Äôs all about risk: benefit imo. When weighing the potential for cognitive impairment from sleep deprivation versus the potential therapeutic effect form micro dosing indica based THC, I think the latter wins out. Personal opinion only, like the rest of what I am writing.\n7) Myrcene (a cannabis based terpine ) can be found in certain teas‚Äô and is probably helpful as well. High concentrations are found in indica based THC.\nAt any rate I will stop now.

I really didn‚Äôt want to take pharmaceuticals, but there‚Äôs really not much else available. I talked with my first doctor about it, as I knew nothing at all about medical cannabis and he really didn‚Äôt either. He said the same thing you‚Äôll hear and read everywhere: There have been no solid clinical, peer-reviewed studies and everyone‚Äôs brain is different and responds differently to medical marijuana (MM). That‚Äôs why it would be virtually impossible for your neurologist to prescribe anything. Doctors know very little about how MM works, and there are literally thousands of MM options, and they vary from state to state. There aren‚Äôt any standardized forms as there are with pharmaceuticals.\nThat said, I got my card and went to my dispensary. I‚Äôve gotten quite an education since then. I tried vaping MM, which is supposed to provide more of an instant relief. I kind of enjoyed the experience of vaping, and it seemed to provide a bit of a calming effect for me, but I have since developed a very dry mouth and throat (not from the vaping, but probably from my meds or PD in general), so vaping isn‚Äôt a good solution for me. I also tried the sublingual oils, and those didn‚Äôt have much of an effect at all, but that might have been due to their strength, the low dosage I was taking, and a bit of general fear I had of them. I had a high CBD/low THC oil for the daytime and a high THC one for nighttime. The daytime one kind of ‚Äútook the edge off‚Äù between my pills (which is what I was hoping it would do), but the nighttime one just made my mind race (and I need something to help with insomnia, fragmented sleep, and restless legs, so that didn‚Äôt help at all).\nI tried the daytime one until I ran out of it, and I recently returned to the dispensary. I‚Äôm now trying two other options (an oil for day ‚Äî 1:19 THC to CBD and another oil for night (1:1 THC to CBD). They are VERY pricey (actually all the MM products are expensive!), but I think these will work much better for me. I‚Äôm mainly using them as an adjunct to my regular PD meds, as I need something to help during ‚Äúoff‚Äù periods. However, if they helped so well that I could give up the pharmaceuticals, I‚Äôd do so in a heartbeat. Occasionally there‚Äôs a story about someone along those lines, but I think the people who get that kind of benefit from MM are few and far between.\nWhat they‚Äôve mostly helped with is calming me down and relaxing me so I‚Äôm not quite as restless and my tremor isn‚Äôt quite as active.

Note: It seems to be acceptable to take as much as 8 pills of 25/100 carbidopa/levo in 24 hour period, and my doses during waking hours are fairly low.

I find that all of the different dispensary‚Äôs in my town in Florida have slightly different products. Have started using 12.5:1 CBD to THC. The dose for anxiety is 20mg (for most concentrations this is one full dropper) sublingual. I like this best in the evening before going out or just for chilling a few hours before bed. Definitely helpful so I am somewhat relaxed when I hit the hay. I have also been struggling mightily with sleep but for the first time in eons think I may have found a solution (for me) as I have now had 3 of the best sleeps I have had in several years after getting this horrible diagnosis. Note: I have tried benzodiazepines, melatonin, antidepressants, exercise, meditation and massage all with little to no avail. So what I do is CBD as above a few hours before bed time, shut lights around 11 PM, and then when I wake at 2 am (which is always) I vape pure indica based THC. Because I can‚Äôt tolerate big ‚Äúhits‚Äù due to a sensitive airway, I take 3 small puffs‚Ä¶have done this 3x now and the result is I have slept 4-5 solid hours more. Wonder drug if this continues! AM tempted to praise the almighty.  (before trying this I would sleep from 12-2am and maybe 5-6am on average.) Don‚Äôt get high or feel euphoric, just relaxed and sleepy. Like a normal person! And the next day I feel like a new man cause I finally got some rest. So the argument against this is that there are not enough studies done to determine the potential cognitive impairment from THC over the long term. But I would argue that the cognitive impairment from chronic sleep deprivation is considerably worse, plus the amount I am ingesting is 3 very small puffs. Note: I have tried sublingual THC , don‚Äôt like it as much cause onset takes too long. Now I can say that the times I feel most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (like myself pre diagnosis) is when I exercise vigorously (which I pretty much do for multiple hours every day) and when I am able to sleep. None of this is a medical recommendation, just thought I would share my journey‚Ä¶.\n'], ['\nJust thought I would add that I am not a fan of the benzodiazepines because of tolerance (need more and more for same effect over time), plus addiction potential (probably the least of our worries with PD but nonetheless a problem.)

The benzos hang out in ur body and are cumulative. The half life of clonazepam, which seems to be the drug the neuro guys like for PD, is something like 40 hours, which means every time you take it half is still in your  body up to 2 days later! (note: others are shorter but are still quite long.) The THC I am ingesting can be considered microdosing. The 3 puffs are very small, just enough to turn the light of the disposable vape pen on for a fraction of a second, it is a minimal inhalation, and I don‚Äôt visibly blow smoke out. I never get high, 4 hours later maybe mildly groggy but it goes away , esp with physical activity. Note: As noted above, I have also microdosed the drops sublingually, which seem to hang around a bit longer, more like 6-8 hours. Add that to the delayed onset using drops and I don‚Äôt like it as much as the inhalation. Note: I am asthmatic, so also have to be careful.  Finally,  it is my opinion (solely anecdotal based on a small sample size) that most neurologists no little to nothing about cannabis, esp in states where it has been recently legalized or remains illegal. I also forgot to say that I take a dose of carbidopa/levodopa ( 25:100) in the middle of the night as well (by itself not enough to put me back to sleep.) Finally, I tried timed release carbidopa:levodopa, didn‚Äôt work well for me at all.

I used to think that any THC was a bad thing, because the last thing I wanted was the jittery and paranoid feeling of being high that I had in my youth (sometime in the middle of the last century when I went to college.)

It is essential for maintaining a healthy barrier between the colon and bloodstream and it prevents inflammation in the gut.\nProponents:\n‚Ä¢Is a major energy source for colon cells\n‚Ä¢Believed to help prevent colon cancer\n‚Ä¢Increases mitochondrial activity\n‚Ä¢Prevents toxins from crossing the gut barrier\n‚Ä¢Improves insulin sensitivity\n‚Ä¢Promotes healthy weight\n‚Ä¢Fight inflammation\n‚Ä¢Prevents the growth of pathogenic bacteria\n‚Ä¢Protects the brain\nSkeptics:\n‚Ä¢Strong odor\n‚Ä¢Lack of high-quality human research\n‚Ä¢Difficult to separate butyrate from other short-chain fatty acids\n1) Gut Health\nButyrate is essential for maintaining a healthy environment in the gut. In the human colon, anaerobic bacteria such as Clostridium butyricum, Roseburia intestinalis, and Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ferment carbohydrates and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs): acetate, propionate, and butyrate [3, 10, 11].\nColon Cell Energy Source\nButyrate nourishes the colon wall, maintains a healthy lining and barrier function of the colon, and prevents intestinal inflammation [4].\nIn the mitochondria of colon cells, 70-90% of butyrate is oxidized into acetyl-CoA, which is then used to generate large quantities of ATP, the primary form of cellular energy [12].\nIf you don‚Äôt have enough butyrate-producing bacteria in your gut, you may be more likely to develop diarrhea, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), and even colon cancer [13, 14, 15, 16, 17].\nInflammatory Bowel Disease\nShort-chain fatty acids, especially butyrate, can reduce the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In one study of 13 people with Crohn‚Äôs disease, a type of IBD, butyrate supplements improved 69% of cases, with symptoms completely disappearing in 54% (seven participants) [18, 19, 20, 21].\nThere are a variety of approaches for using butyrate to manage IBD and colitis. The treatment strategies range from a high-fiber diet to butyrate-producing probiotics, coated butyrate tablets, and rectal enemas [22, 23].\nDiarrhea & Gut Inflammation\nResistant starch is a type of soluble fiber that your gut bacteria can ferment into butyrate. A diet containing lots of resistant starch improved diarrhea in a trial of 57 baby boys [24].\nButyrate can also prevent inflammation and stomach ulcers caused by alcohol. Mice given butyrate before alcohol had less inflammation and damage to the lining of their stomachs [25].\nSodium butyrate in combination with other SCFAs and silicon dioxide was also shown to benefit traveler‚Äôs diarrhea, a condition common among those who travel to exotic countries [26].\nAccording to a great many studies, butyrate is vital for healthy gut flora, controlling inflammation, and maintaining a strong intestinal barrier.\n2) Inflammation\nButyrate suppresses the activity of cells and proteins that drive inflammation [27].\nIn one study on human cells, butyrate drastically reduced the activity of interleukin-12 (IL-12), an inflammatory cytokine, while increasing interleukin-10 (IL-10), which is generally anti-inflammatory [28].\nIn mice, butyrate-producing dietary fibers counteracted inflammation and illness caused by bacterial toxins. The inflammatory cytokines inhibited by butyrate included interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), and interferon gamma (INF-y) [29].\nImmune Response\nButyrate may reduce inflammation by increasing the activity of immune cells called regulatory T cells or Tregs. These specialized cells stop other immune cells ‚Äì Th1, Th2, and Th17 ‚Äì in their tracks, before they lose control. In turn, Tregs prevent the lining of the gut from overreacting to harmless food proteins [30].\nGut Barrier\nButyrate also strengthens the barrier formed by cells in the colon wall, thus preventing microbes and bacterial toxins from invading the bloodstream [31].\nInflammation Due to Aging\nAs we grow older, inflammation increases throughout our bodies. In aging mice, a diet high in fiber that produces butyrate counteracted age-related increases in inflammation, suggesting that butyrate may be especially helpful to the elderly. Human studies will be required to confirm this benefit, however [32].\nAnimal and cell studies show that butyrate inhibits inflammatory cytokines and prevents inflammatory bacterial toxins from entering the bloodstream.\n3) Fine-Tuning the Immune System\nAs an HDAC inhibitor, butyrate adjusts the immune system in a number of ways.\nHDAC inhibitors improve the tumor-targeting abilities of immune cells like T cells and natural killer cells; they are currently under investigation as potential cancer drugs. This class of compounds also reduces many inflammatory signals and increases Tregs, a type of white blood cell that prevents allergies and autoimmunity [33, 34, 35].\nButyrate more specifically protects the gut barrier and prevents pathogens and other harmful agents from crossing into the bloodstream [36].\n4) Brain and Nerve Cells\nThe gut and the microbiome strongly affect the brain. Your gut bacteria ‚Äútalk‚Äù to your cells by releasing butyrate, which (as an HDAC inhibitor) turns on certain genes [37].\nCognition\nButyrate may improve learning and long-term memory. Similar to exercise, sodium butyrate increased brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in mice. Simply put, butyrate supplies ‚Äúbrain food‚Äù (neuro = brain, trophic = food) to the hippocampus, the brain‚Äôs hub for memory and emotions. This gives birth to new neurons, called neurogenesis, a process that can reshape the brain [38].\nThe effect of butyrate supplements or intestinal butyrate concentration on cognition has not been tested in humans. However, this effect has been repeated multiple times in animals, and probiotics containing butyrate-producing bacteria have been associated with reduced stress in humans. Human trials on butyrate and cognition are likely to be next [39, 40, 32, 41].\nBrain Injury\nThere‚Äôs a huge overlap between cognitive enhancement and recovery from brain damage. Both rely on neurogenesis, a process that replenishes and reshapes the brain.\nIn a mouse study, sodium butyrate given after a stroke supported the development of new nerve cells in the damaged areas. It also strengthened the blood-brain barrier in mice with brain trauma, which helped them recover. Butyrate-producing bacteria also strengthened this barrier in mice [42, 43, 44].\nClostridium butyricum, a butyrate-producing species of bacteria, may help manage vascular dementia, a disease whereby blood vessel blockages prevent brain cells from getting enough oxygen. In a mouse study, animals with C. butyricum in the gut experienced less cell death in their brains [45].\nThese effects have not yet been investigated in human trials.\nNerve Damage\nButyrate may also help manage other types of nerve damage. In guinea pigs, sodium butyrate protected nerve cells in the ear after treatment with antibiotics, thus preventing hearing loss [46].\nMice with brain damage due to lack of oxygen fared better when they were given the butyrate-producing bacteria Clostridium butyricum before the injury [47].\nSodium butyrate also prevented the death of nerve cells in the spine of mice with spinal muscular atrophy [48].\nAnimal studies show that butyrate is neuroprotective and may improve memory and reduce the impact of brain trauma. Human trials will be needed to confirm these effects.\n Food Sources\nYou get can butyrate from food. For example, butyric acid abounds dairy products, especially butter. Butter, which gave butyrate its name, contains about 3 to 4% of butyrate in the form of tributyrin. Plant oils also contain butyrate to some extent [115, 116, 117].\nEating more fiber increases butyrate production by some bacteria in your gut. There is generally an association between a higher intake of plant foods and increased levels of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), including butyrate, in stools. However, not all plant-based foods yield butyrate; for example, diets rich in fruit or starch are associated with high butyrate levels in the gut, but starch-free wheat bran is not [118, 119, 120, 121].\nDepending on the composition of your gut flora, the following fibers may encourage them to produce SFCAs, including butyrate [122, 123, 124]:\n‚Ä¢Inulin: artichokes, garlic, leeks, onions, and asparagus\n‚Ä¢Fructooligosaccharides (FOS): fruits and vegetables, including bananas, onions, garlic, and asparagus\n‚Ä¢Resistant starch: cooked and cooled rice, potatoes and green bananas\n‚Ä¢Pectin: apples, apricots, carrots, oranges, and others\n‚Ä¢Oat bran\n‚Ä¢Arabinoxylan\n‚Ä¢Guar gum\n‚Ä¢Arabinogalactan\n‚Ä¢Hi-Maize, potato or plantain starch flours\n'], ['\nI buy Butyrex¬Æ by T.E.Neesby online.

So as far as medical science goes, at best this is in the realm of ‚Äúguesswork‚Äù. In states where cannabis is still illegal I think a presumption can be made that most docs either know NOTHING or are hesitant to say anything (as they should be) because they don‚Äôt want to put their licenses in jeopardy. I personally have consulted with 5 different docs in two states who ‚Äúspecialize‚Äù in this, 3 appeared to be quacks and 2 appeared to me to be the real deal. This is in addition to multiple neurologists. Have also visited multiple dispensaries and talked to a lot of people.\xa0 What I learned so far (all comments are my personal observations only, do not hold up to scientific rigor) :\n1)this is NOT about getting high, which I think is a really bad idea for PD patients due to the cognitive impairment that can result.\n2) Probably best to get products from dispensary (need a card for this), as there are beneficial effects utilizing all the compounds and terpenes in the plants, which I don‚Äôt think you can get when trying to buy elsewhere. Also think products bought at dispensary probably have a more accurate profile in what you are actually ingesting.\n3)Personally I think sublingual drops are the way to go; though vaping has a quicker onset, don‚Äôt think there is enough data about the safety of inhaling anything, and given that PD patients are at a higher risk for aspiration pneumonia, don‚Äôt like the concept of adding another irritant to the airway.\n4) Cannabis products are sativa based, indica based or hybrids. Sativa is more for the head and has more psychoactive properties, indica more for the body.\xa0 There are certain terpenes in each that have different effects.\xa0 I think what we want is indica based compounds that relax the body.\n5) CBD is not psychoactive (and the trace THC found it sold by dispensaries is likely meaningless), and is probably the safest product to use though like with the rest of cannabis more studies are needed. Most of the CBD sold does not tell you whether it is indica or sativa based. However some dispensaries do. If you can find one that sells indica based CBD, I think that is the way to go to help with anxiety, tremors and insomnia. It definitely relaxes the body (subtly). It generally comes in vials\xa0 with a dropper that tell you the mg and cc in each vial. You have to do the math to dose it. I find 5-10 mg sublingual to be helpful (in most concentrations this is about half a dropper, but again need to calculate). Probably best to start very low and titrate up. Best guess is 1-3x per day is probably ok, as needed.\n6) THC products should be treated with extreme caution. I think most neuro docs would be against it because of the potential for cognitive impairment. I see no reason for a PD patient to mess with sativa based THC (really ever), which is what gets people the ‚Äúhighest‚Äù.\xa0 (Unless going to a Woodstock reunion ;weak attempt at humor).\xa0 However, indica based THC can be microdosed using a dropper that comes with the vial. 1-2 drops under the tongue at bedtime (dose is a tiny fraction of a mg) has been highly recommended\xa0 for insomnia (doesn‚Äôt get you high).\xa0 \xa0It‚Äôs all about risk: benefit imo. When weighing the potential for cognitive impairment from sleep deprivation versus the potential therapeutic effect form micro dosing indica based THC, I think the latter wins out. Personal opinion only, like the rest of what I am writing.\n7) Myrcene (a cannabis based terpine ) can be found in certain teas‚Äô and is probably helpful as well. High concentrations are found in indica based THC.\nAt any rate I will stop now.

I really didn‚Äôt want to take pharmaceuticals, but there‚Äôs really not much else available. I talked with my first doctor about it, as I knew nothing at all about medical cannabis and he really didn‚Äôt either. He said the same thing you‚Äôll hear and read everywhere: There have been no solid clinical, peer-reviewed studies and everyone‚Äôs brain is different and responds differently to medical marijuana (MM). That‚Äôs why it would be virtually impossible for your neurologist to prescribe anything. Doctors know very little about how MM works, and there are literally thousands of MM options, and they vary from state to state. There aren‚Äôt any standardized forms as there are with pharmaceuticals.\nThat said, I got my card and went to my dispensary. I‚Äôve gotten quite an education since then. I tried vaping MM, which is supposed to provide more of an instant relief. I kind of enjoyed the experience of vaping, and it seemed to provide a bit of a calming effect for me, but I have since developed a very dry mouth and throat (not from the vaping, but probably from my meds or PD in general), so vaping isn‚Äôt a good solution for me. I also tried the sublingual oils, and those didn‚Äôt have much of an effect at all, but that might have been due to their strength, the low dosage I was taking, and a bit of general fear I had of them. I had a high CBD/low THC oil for the daytime and a high THC one for nighttime. The daytime one kind of ‚Äútook the edge off‚Äù between my pills (which is what I was hoping it would do), but the nighttime one just made my mind race (and I need something to help with insomnia, fragmented sleep, and restless legs, so that didn‚Äôt help at all).\nI tried the daytime one until I ran out of it, and I recently returned to the dispensary. I‚Äôm now trying two other options (an oil for day ‚Äî 1:19 THC to CBD and another oil for night (1:1 THC to CBD). They are VERY pricey (actually all the MM products are expensive!), but I think these will work much better for me. I‚Äôm mainly using them as an adjunct to my regular PD meds, as I need something to help during ‚Äúoff‚Äù periods.

Their effects are very subtle ‚Äî nothing drastic (at least not for me). I‚Äôm going to continue with them to see if the more I use them the more effective they will be. Note that dosage is highly individual (another reason a neurologist can‚Äôt prescribe a product or dosage). I suggest going to your dispensary and talking with the pharmacist there. They will be able to educate you about the various products available, how to use them, what might be best for you based on your symptoms, and what dosage to start with and how to tritrate up.\nMore research is being done in this area, but much more is needed.

Note: It seems to be acceptable to take as much as 8 pills of 25/100 carbidopa/levo in 24 hour period, and my doses during waking hours are fairly low.

I find that all of the different dispensary‚Äôs in my town in Florida have slightly different products. Have started using 12.5:1 CBD to THC. The dose for anxiety is 20mg (for most concentrations this is one full dropper) sublingual. I like this best in the evening before going out or just for chilling a few hours before bed. Definitely helpful so I am somewhat relaxed when I hit the hay. I have also been struggling mightily with sleep but for the first time in eons think I may have found a solution (for me) as I have now had 3 of the best sleeps I have had in several years after getting this horrible diagnosis. Note: I have tried benzodiazepines, melatonin, antidepressants, exercise, meditation and massage all with little to no avail. So what I do is CBD as above a few hours before bed time, shut lights around 11 PM, and then when I wake at 2 am (which is always) I vape pure indica based THC. Because I can‚Äôt tolerate big ‚Äúhits‚Äù due to a sensitive airway, I take 3 small puffs‚Ä¶have done this 3x now and the result is I have slept 4-5 solid hours more. Wonder drug if this continues! AM tempted to praise the almighty.  (before trying this I would sleep from 12-2am and maybe 5-6am on average.) Don‚Äôt get high or feel euphoric, just relaxed and sleepy. Like a normal person! And the next day I feel like a new man cause I finally got some rest. So the argument against this is that there are not enough studies done to determine the potential cognitive impairment from THC over the long term. But I would argue that the cognitive impairment from chronic sleep deprivation is considerably worse, plus the amount I am ingesting is 3 very small puffs. Note: I have tried sublingual THC , don‚Äôt like it as much cause onset takes too long. Now I can say that the times I feel most ‚Äúnormal‚Äù (like myself pre diagnosis) is when I exercise vigorously (which I pretty much do for multiple hours every day) and when I am able to sleep. None of this is a medical recommendation, just thought I would share my journey‚Ä¶.\n'], ['\nJust thought I would add that I am not a fan of the benzodiazepines because of tolerance (need more and more for same effect over time), plus addiction potential (probably the least of our worries with PD but nonetheless a problem.)

Just one man‚Äôs opinion fwiw.\n'], ['\nAndrew thanks for sharing. \xa0I agree with you on the benzodiazepines. \xa0 My late husband was addicted to Ativan. \xa0 \xa0Bad stuff. I believe it is only a matter of time before these drugs are put in same class (in terms of addiction ) like the opioids\n'], ['\nHi Andrew,\nSo you feel that the benzodiazepines makes you more groggy the next day than vaping THC at 2 A.M.?\nMy biggest concern with THC is grogginess/being spacy \xa0the next day\nThanks\n'], ['\nThe short answer is yes. The benzos hang out in ur body and are cumulative. The half life of clonazepam, which seems to be the drug the neuro guys like for PD, is something like 40 hours, which means every time you take it half is still in your  body up to 2 days later! (note: others are shorter but are still quite long.) The THC I am ingesting can be considered microdosing. The 3 puffs are very small, just enough to turn the light of the disposable vape pen on for a fraction of a second, it is a minimal inhalation, and I don‚Äôt visibly blow smoke out. I never get high, 4 hours later maybe mildly groggy but it goes away , esp with physical activity. Note: As noted above, I have also microdosed the drops sublingually, which seem to hang around a bit longer, more like 6-8 hours. Add that to the delayed onset using drops and I don‚Äôt like it as much as the inhalation. Note: I am asthmatic, so also have to be careful.  Finally,  it is my opinion (solely anecdotal based on a small sample size) that most neurologists no little to nothing about cannabis, esp in states where it has been recently legalized or remains illegal. I also forgot to say that I take a dose of carbidopa/levodopa ( 25:100) in the middle of the night as well (by itself not enough to put me back to sleep.) Finally, I tried timed release carbidopa:levodopa, didn‚Äôt work well for me at all. Again this is obviously just what has worked for me, not giving medical advice or suggesting what others do.\n'], ['\nIn my 12th PD year I‚Äôve learned to be minimalist and patient and to avoid running after the miracle molecule of the month.

I have also used 10 mg in the day, but do better with 20mg as an anxietolytic dosage, mainly at night.

I used to think that any THC was a bad thing, because the last thing I wanted was the jittery and paranoid feeling of being high that I had in my youth (sometime in the middle of the last century when I went to college.) But my thinking has evolved as there are many beneficial effects in the whole flower not only from THC but from the terpines and other compounds which all somehow work collectively in the so called ‚Äúentourage effect‚Äù.

Legalizing marijuana for recreational use will make this dangerous choice more attractive.\n‚ÄúCB1Rs (one type of cannabis receptor) are found at the terminals of central and peripheral neurons, where they mostly mediate inhibitory action on ongoing release of a number of excitatory and inhibitory dopaminergic, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), glutamatergic, serotoninergic, noradrenalin and acetylcholine  neurotransmitter systems.  Because of the involvement of these systems they affect functions such as cognition, memory, motor movements and pain perception. Interesting ‚Äì I wouldn‚Äôt mind if it inhibited my inhibitory dopamine transporter system, but leave my excitatory dopamine system alone! Will this interact positively or negatively with my PD meds? We don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶\n‚ÄúThe involvement of the particular neural regions and the neurotransmitter systems here is significant due to the fact that the very same brain areas and neurotransmitter systems are also implicated in psychoses, particularly in schizophrenia . Furthermore those who are at ultra high risk for psychosis have been reported to be more sensitive to the psychotogenic effects of cannabis compared with users in the general population. A psychotic outcome is not the only diagnostic category which has been associated with cannabis use. Symptoms of depression and anxiety commonly coexist with cannabis use and lead to diagnostic dilemmas ‚Äú Y‚Äôall do know we PwPs are a whole lot likelier to get psychosis, depression, etc, right? Although some of the chemicals in marijuana have been shown to ease depression an anxiety, you have to isolate those out of the 400 first, or you could make yourself worse!\n‚ÄúNatural compounds of the cannabis plant are also referred to as phytocannabinoids of which d-9-THC is the main psychoactive ingredient and has been widely researched both in animals and humans. It characteristically produces, in a dose-dependent manner, hypoactivity, hypothermia, spatial and verbal short-term memory impairment. However, the second major compound, CBD, does not affect locomotor activity, body temperature or memory on its own. However, higher doses of CBD can potentiate the lower doses of d-9-THC by enhancing the level of CB1R expression in the hippocampus and hypothalamus.‚Äù Oh great ‚Äì the 2 dominant cannabinoids not only oppose each other, but the good one makes the bad one work better!. The scary thing, if you use marijuana, is, ‚Äúd-9-THC was found to be ‚Ä¶significantly higher than recorded 10 years previously. However, the CBD content was found to be extremely low in more recent times. These findings suggest that current trends for preferring higher THC content variants carry significant health risks, particularly to those who are susceptible to its harmful effects‚Äù so, the marijuana of today has more of the bad hyoactivity, poor memory one, and less of the one that might be helpful‚Ä¶except that more of it might make the effects of the bad one worse! At what dose? And remember all of those little plants are different, so you might get one dose that‚Äôs really stronger than your last dose.\nThere are a lot of moving parts here! Incorrectly balanced, they can cause serious harm. Long term mental effects might actually be worse than short term ‚Äúit helps me right now‚Äù benefits. Are you willing to risk that? We need to know more! There may be some really good stuff there, but more research needs to be done (and you risk-takers can volunteer for the studies! )\n'], ['\nThanks for your thoughts, Gail.\nYeah, my Dad (diagnosed in 2013) has his medical marijuana card.

A recent autopsy case report of an individual that received implants of fetal dopamine neurons 16 years previously, but at no time experienced clinical benefit despite the best documented survival of grafted neurons and most extensive reinnervation of the striatum, raises sobering issues. With good reason, a great deal of effort in cell replacement science continues to focus on optimizing the cell source and implantation procedure. Here, we describe our preclinical studies in aged rats indicating that despite survival of large numbers of transplanted dopamine neurons and dense reinnervation of the striatum, synaptic connections between graft and host are markedly decreased and behavioral recovery is impaired. This leads us to the hypothesis that the variability in therapeutic response to dopamine neuron grafts may be less about the viability of transplanted neurons and more about the integrity of the aged, dopamine‚Äêdepleted striatum and its capacity for repair. Replacement of dopamine innervation only can be fully effective if the correct target is present. ¬© 2019 The Authors.

Then, at 14.45 minutes into his 17 minute talk, he says that brisk walking for 45 minutes 2 to 3 times a week dramatically improves dementia and actually changes the brain,\xa0 He had explained about the build-up of substances in the brain (that sounded similar to those in PD, ie amaloyd plaques or lewy bodies?) His talk does not explain HOW the exercise works but he does have evidence that it works. So that might reinforce your own authentic experience, because if dementia and PD share any similarities ie if they both share amaloyd plaque build up, then it is possible that both conditions might benefit from excercise for the same reasons, whatever the reason is.\nI suspect that if PD has progressed to make excercise difficult, it might be a big ask to sugggest exercise but it sounds worth trying if it is still possible, even just to ward off dementia.\nThen in a recent newspaper headline one woman had apparently recovered from dementia by eating blueberries, walnuts and exercising, after her son learned that a particular culture did not get dementia.\xa0 I remember wondering whether her exercise was simply increasing oxygen to the brain ie maybe helping vascular denentia and whether that culture just didn‚Äôt eat processed foods.\nMaybe excercise‚Äôs increased pulse or blood-flow does something to the brain or maybe builds the nerves/muscles that cures or compensates?\nI have read/watched so many articles/books/online talks that all seem related, about potential cures for brain-related conditions:\nCannabid oil stimulating brain repair after TBI (traumatic brain injury)\nSweet bell peppers providing nicotine instead of smoking to protect against PD\nCilantro (coriander) was recently found to remove toxic metals from the body and I think I read that copper iron or zinc might be factors? I‚Äôm not sure if it would remove mercury from the brain.\n(Would anti-smoking nicotine patches work as a protective strategy?)\nI even read of ONE man who had a fecal implant which allegedly reversed his PD symptoms.(I read that in a book so could trace it I hope)\nI am new to this site and all of the above is stuff I picked up from various online sites, so would need to trace it for you if necessary. One TED talk about ADHD, dopamine and fruit flies, mentioned the dopamine factor in adhd as well as in PD.\xa0 This alarmed me as I was researching ADHD and we had a fatal PD type illness in our family, as well as current ADHD. A quick google seemed to reflect that medicated ADHD sufferers are 8 to 9 times more likely to develop PD. As I now believe both run in my family I am now reading all I can about both.\nIf you are able to enlighten me on any of the above topics I would be really interested as you have probably researched many similar topics already.

Eating well; plant based meaning no dairy, no meat, no processed foods, no or minimal added sugar and gluten free are important.\xa0 A balanced exercise program\xa0 that includes cardio, flexibility and strength training is critical.\xa0 A good diet and exercise program cannot hurt.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nHello Jean,\nThank-you so much for your kind reply. I bought several books about brain health when 3 elderly relatives were each in hospital in the same year for different brain related reasons (vascular dementia, PD type illness (MSA; it is like PD but was on both sides of the body) and brain injury). Then I recently researched various autism spectrum conditions so I only have a rough overview but noticed many over-lapping themes. I noticed that many of the interesting posts on here I read were from you and after reading the one about gluten, I later read in a brain-food book how much damage gluten and inflammation does, which mirrored your article. I wanted to tell you how huge this topic was generally although the book was about gluten on the brain, not about PD.\nThere has been so much in the last few years about good bacteria and the link between the gut and the brain and also gluten and the brain as well as info about migration of irritants/toxins through a leaky gut, leaky blood/brain barrier, root canal fillings, or the vegus nerve, and using coconut oil flax seed and turmeric. Pleasingly, most of this stuff all fits together harmoniously and each theory seems to support the others. All this reading was so far about dementia and more recently about ADHD and not necessatily about PD, except the research I did about it when trying to help the relative with MSA and found out about bell peppers/nicotine.\nLast night, after reading your gluten article I read in a book about how the gut produces the signal for other cells to die contrary to previous belief and therefore inflammation or good bacteria in the gut can indeed logically have dramatic bad or protective effects respectively on distant organs via angered gut cells or calmed ones. This was suddenly the explanation that made everything make sense, ie each theory seeming equally convincing but now they fit together! I even read a newspaper advert once advertising a new gut bacteria pill that claimed to cure IBS by coating the gut with a protective film. I guess that would also explain how a fecal transplant in theory would work, by presumably introducing the right, curative bacteria. Even the doctors from The Twinstitute tv show did a stage show in which they said that it actually takes 2 months to heal a gut damaged by alcohol. Again, the idea of gut damage causing leakage into the body.\nI have just read some online articles speculating about some form of PD being possibly linked to tainted batches of drugs or to viruses or lack of sleep and how it clustered around professions that have contact with others (ie exposure to viruses) ie teachers, rather than people who stay home a lot. This is yet another interesting angle. The books I bought have probably been superceded by now (for instance, I am now wondering what telomeres do if a gut can kill distant cells; I will need to compare articles) but there is plenty about treating dementia by eliminating all the same things ie toxins,and all dementia‚Äôs contributory factors (over 30), so it might be that googling other conditions might throw something new up that interests you that was not initially intended to relate to PD. I think I even read last year that the shingles virus might be a factor in PD, especially interesting if both affect one side of the body. Is this a known factor?\nIf anything I have mentioned is useful I will try to find the source for you and I will let you know if I discover anything I got wrong.I am trying to remember everything without access right now to my books. Thank-you Jean. I hope I haven‚Äôt mis-understood and mis-reported anything as I realise how misleading that would be.\n'], ['\nhi carole, once again, thank you for all this information.\xa0 I do believe some people can be helped more than others by by some of these remedies, whether it is zandopa, red pepper, gluten free, butyric acid. our makeups are so different and the human body is so complex.\xa0 .

The difference is that Neupro is a patch that releases the medicine onto the skin, where the medicine then passes through the skin (transdermal) and is absorbed into the body.\nThe monograph accompanying the product contains the usual precautions, including nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, dizziness, in the 10 to 15% range for the 4mg/24hr patch. I have been using the 4mg/24hr patch for about a year now and it has produced no side effects as far as I can tell‚ÄìParkinson‚Äôs itself and the other meds for it cause side effects such as\xa0 constipation, so it‚Äôs hard to separate.\nPersonal use and experience: Take the advice not to put the patch on a skin area that contains hair. The patch adhesive is quite strong, even pulling it from a hairless area is rather unpleasant. My neurologist has me put the patch on at 10 pm and take off at 6 am, to help what he thinks is RLS (restless leg syndrome), but which I think is spinal myoclonus. Also, a bit of a headache is that the same skin area cannot be used again for two weeks, meaning that you have to identify and track 14 places on your body that you will visit sequentially every two weeks.\nThe Neupro patch does seem to help a little. Sometimes when I forget to put it on, I sleep the same way as when I had stuck it on. Other times, I think I do sense that it is doing something.\nSo far, good. I‚Äôve had bad experience with dopamine agonists. Before I was clearly diagnosed with PD, I went to a doctor who prescribed Requip (rpiniriole), which caused me to nearly lose consciousness at work. A few months later, I was prescribed Mirapex (pramipexole) 2.5 mg/ tid and I almost fell asleep while driving. After some research, I read that studies have shown that 1 mg/tid provides the most therapeutic dose and that more doesn‚Äôt help. So I stayed on it for along time, then reduced it to 1mg at bedtime to function as sleep aid. Finally, since it wasn‚Äôt doing much to help my insomnia, I quit that and now don‚Äôt take any praimipexole.\n[Remember that you cannot generalize from one Parky to another, and that you should consult a neurologist\xa0 specializing in movement disorders / Parkinsonism before making any changes.]\n'], ['\nI have been on Neupro for several years.\xa0 My movement disorder neurologist started me at 1mg and ramped me up to 8mg which I have used for at least 4 or 5 years.\xa0 Also 7.5 tabs/day of Sinemet, 1mg Azilect (rasagiline) and Amantadine (2/day).\xa0 No side effects from the Neupro.\xa0 My understanding of Neupro‚Äôs advantage is a more even availability, over time,\xa0 in the body than oral agonists.\xa0 Only two downsides:\xa0 Even with Medicare Part D it is very very pricey.\xa0 Also, you need to develop a chart for placement or you get itchy dermatitis.\xa0 (e.g:\xa0 Monday ‚Äìleft arm, upper, front; tuesday left arm, lower , front‚Ä¶etc.)\xa0 or you can use the chart on the manufacturer‚Äôs website).\xa0 I have a seven day rotation schedule.\xa0 The mfg recommends 14 days.\xa0 My neurologist says in my case the arms work better than other locations.\xa0 8mg patches use\xa0 a lot of real-estate.\xa0 Remember:\xa0 ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply to us ‚ÄúParkies‚Äù.\n'], ['\nMy neurologist is anxious for me to try Neupro, because my chief complaint is that I am deeply affected, both physically and mentally, when I enter those terrible ‚Äúoff‚Äù\xa0 periods when my Rytary does not work as well as it should.

To avoid the risk of the patch coming off, not likely in the shower unless not applied firmly,  I tape it on with strong waterproof tape or get one of those waterproof cover seal patches to put over it to keep it dry and on.\nYou are fortunate you are being advised patches and a reduction in levodopa i have gone other way doubled the levodopa/carbidopa 250/25 mg and now looking at 16 mg patches and doing an apomorphine test on the 21st of this month to assess to either increasing oral/patch meds or having a dopamine pump.  All because my off days come more frequently, last longer, are more severe, and take longer to recover from. So for my own sanity and that of my wonderful fiancee, who is also my primary caregiver who still works 12 hrs a day 5 days a week and to relieve the concerns and frustration of brilliant MS Neurologist we all know we have to do something rather severe and soon.\nI have had no problems with the patches as long I place them on air dry, wrinkle free skin like outer edge of shoulder and top of thigh. I find it also helps if you shave those areas occasionally as the patches seem to stick better.  Also when you remove the patch rubbing some tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil on the place where the patch was removes any residual adhesive and helps avoid any irritation, reactions or itchiness that may occur during or after you remove the patch.  And don‚Äôt forget to rotate around 4 or 5 different places on your body every morning when you apply, repetitive placements on the same place for multiple days can cause some really nasty irritations.\nGood luck with the Neupro Patches and I really hope they do the trick for you.

What I ended up doing (after ripping it off after one day of almost total shut-down), was I weaned myself on to the patch, just using half a patch a day, plus reduced my dopamine to pre-dyskenisia dosage (all on Dr.s orders, of course). So now, after two months I feel OK, but I can‚Äôt honestly say my tremor or stiffness is any better. I still feel like I need more dopamine. I think I notice it the most with my sleeping, which is to say I mostly sleep through the night instead of tossing and turning for a couple of hours each night like I used to. Also my dyskinesia is gone. My insurance does not cover it, so I am \xa0debating whether it is worth the price ($122/month).\nMy plan at this point is to wait a bit longer, hopefully get back to my ‚Äònormal‚Äô level of exercise when the gyms open again, and see what unfolds in the next 2-3 months.\nThanks for sharing.\n\xa0\n'], ['Posts']]"

June 2017 diagnosed with Parkinsons\n2. Consultant prescribed Rasagaline (with Madopar/Sinemet to follow later)\n3. 2017- April 2019 continued as per 2\n4. April 2019-June 2019 started Madopar 50/12.5Mg no benefit (consultant queried Parkinsons diagnosis) some side effects discontinued Madopar\n5. July 2019 CT scan all clear no abnormalities\n6. August 2019 anxiety becomes a problem commence meds (Pregabalin)\n7. December 2019 anxiety worse Pregabalin increased 100Mg x 3 times/day.\n8. December 2019 Dat scan requested ,anxiety much worse . Madopar 50/12.5Mg restarted. x 3 doses per day\n9. January 2020 Dat scan ,severe dopamine deficit Parkinsons confirmed. Madopar increased 100/25Mg x 4 doses per day\n10. February 2020 Madopar increased 150/37.5Mg x 4 doses/day\n11. March 2020 Anxiety very bad Pregabalin continues as per 7 no apparent improvement\nIt was around June last year that all of the family was with her (myself, wife and children) and she at that point was not too bad. We actually live in Spain so I/we dont see that much of her unfortunately. For some months now she hasn¬¥t really wanted visitors at all. My father lives with her in the UK.\nSince last June however she seems to have gone down hill quite quickly and as mentioned above in January this year her DAT Scan showed severe dopamine deficiency. She mainly had the DAT scan as the Madopar did not seem to be helping her much and follwing the DAT scan the dosage was increased. She is now on a dosage of 150/37.5Mg x 4 doses/day.\nShe is also suffering with quite bad anxiety for which she is taking Pregabalin.\nUnfortunately the Pregabalin does not seem to be decreasing her anxiety much and the Madopar only seems to work for an hour or so although she only has been taking the current dosage since February.\nThe thing that causes alot of anxiety and seems to stress her the most is the shaking which she has on both sides of her body. As I understand stress and anxiety can worsen the tremor so its a bit catch 22.\nIt seems that the anxiety is really affecting her at the moment perhaps as much as the PD with regards to her general state and quality of life.\nSo‚Ä¶.I am wondering if others have had a similar experience and if anyone can offer any advice.\nThanks in advance for any comments and I hope you are all managing to take care of yourselves and stay safe in the current situation that we all find ourselves.\n'], ['\nHello, Steve.\nI‚Äôm a person with PD.\xa0 I‚Äôm blessed to have my wife as my care partner.\xa0 My PD is in early stages yet, and my neurologist and my primary doctor have treated my wife as an important team member from the start.\xa0 Sometimes, it‚Äôs no more than a squeeze of my hand or an arm around the shoulder.\xa0 She hears my watch beeping before I do, and reminds me it‚Äôs time for my med‚Äôs.\xa0 She has been with me on every appointment, and we discuss every change or sign of progression.\xa0 So we‚Äôre on a good foundation for what the future brings.\nWith you in Spain and your mother in the UK, I really don‚Äôt know how to advise.\xa0 Your mother needs a care partner by her side, and I hope it‚Äôs not too late for someone to take on that role.\xa0 Is your father being a care partner for her?\nAnd it‚Äôs really the neurologist and the doctor together that need to advise on meds and dosage.\nPatience is key.\xa0 PD is something that will go on changing, as you‚Äôve already experienced, and change is liable to be hard for your mother.\nI don‚Äôt want to sound judgmental, but this is really from my heart.\xa0 We‚Äôre wishing you and your family all the best as you search for solutions,\nPhil\n'], ['\nHI Steve,\nit sounds as though your Mom is having a tough time.\xa0 \xa0I am sorry for her struggles.\xa0 You are a good son, trying to do the best for your Mom and I am sure she must\xa0 take comfort in that.\xa0 You didnt say how old she\xa0 is or what her mobility is like, but, I have found exercise to be the BEST thing for Parkinson‚Äôs and more and more doctors are stressing this.\xa0 Rock Steady Boxing is the best thing to ever happen to me and many others with PD.\xa0 I have seen people come in with a walker and extreme lack of mobility on their own, and after a few months of classes 2x/week, they were able to forego their walker.\xa0 \xa0The classes are for people with PD only and all levels of ability.\xa0 there are a few in UK, Glasgow, Widnes and Wirral.\xa0 here is a link:\xa0 https://rocksteadyboxing.org/find-a-class/#go_here\n\xa0\nDance for PD is also an excellent program and they have online classes that can be taken:\xa0 https://danceforparkinsons.org\nI don‚Äôt know anything about Madopar or Pregabalin so I cannot comment on them.\xa0 One thing for sure, PD manifests itself differently in everyone, both in terms of rate of progression and what therapies will work or not work.\nI am not a health professional so I can only speak from my experiences.\xa0 Bottom line, I believe movement and exercise are the best things to combat stress, anxiety, PD symptoms and PD progression.\xa0 \xa0I do take carbidopa/levodopa and selegeline so that I can exercise.\xa0 \xa0 I wish you luck and hope for the best for your Mom.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nSteve, I did a little research on Madopar.\xa0 Apparently that is a brand name for benserazide/levodopa.\xa0 \xa0It seems in Europe, benserazide is used while carbidopa is used in the USA with levodopa .\xa0 \xa0The function of both benserazide and carbidopa is the same; helps to prevent nausea caused by premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain.\xa0 I have found with this disease, that one must be proactive (the caregiver and person with PD) and must educate themselves.\xa0 I have found a book, The New Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Treatment Book (2015 edition) by Dr. Eric Ahlskog to be a great reference book\n'], ['\nHi Steve,\nI‚Äôm sorry your mom is having such a rough time.\xa0 I was diagnosed in Jan. 2011, and the summer of 2013 was absolutely my worst time, so I hope my response will provide some encouragement.\xa0 I see that your mom is on anti-anxiety meds (so am I), but I don‚Äôt see an anti-depressant in your information.\xa0 I started taking the lowest dosage of Venlafaxine XR capsules during that summer of 2013, and that was the first step to getting my life back.\xa0 It does take something like six weeks to be effective, but for me it was totally worth it.\nThe next step, and on this I totally agree with Jean, was to get involved in exercise classes that my local hospital offers.\xa0 I started with T‚Äôai Chi, then added Beginner‚Äôs Yoga, and then added an exercise class.\xa0 These classes are for those of us over 65, and most of us in fact have some condition which may well call for a modification of some of the activities, which is considered fine.\xa0 I have been doing these three classes for years (Right now, of course, we are not having classes because of Covid-19, but some of the classes are starting to be reactivated with the help of Zoom so we can follow these online while we are at home.), and they have given me my life back!\xa0 I never would have expected, at 73, to be going to classes like these, but they are so much fun, I have met so many people who have become friends, and I have regained balance, flexibility, and stamina.\nI do also follow many PD support programs and groups online, and one thing I read recently was that there seems to be little correlation to the amount of tremor one has and to the quality of life, but that there is a huge correlation to loneliness and quality of life with PD.\xa0 I\xa0 certainly believe this is true.\xa0 Your mom may not be receptive to going to a class like this, but have your dad check out what is available and then gently suggest that she tries one.\xa0 Libraries as well as hospitals by me offer inexpensive programs like this, and though I have not been able to find one of the programs that are specifically for those with PD, for me that has not been a problem.\nI do deal with anxiety fairly often, so I always have my anti-anxiety meds with me, but I find that when I am out and having a good time with my friends I hardly ever need them at that time.\nI remember how I was in the summer of 2013, and that person did not believe that a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù kind of life would ever be possible again.\xa0 Since then, my husband and I have traveled around the US as well as taking some international trips.\xa0 For me life is good ‚Äì sometimes a bit challenging, but an adventure that I am happy to take.\xa0 I wish that for your mom!\n'], ['\nButyric acid supplements, have her try them. They worked for me in reversing my PD. Anxiety is also gone.\n'], ['\nHi Steve, I‚Äôve dealt with severe anxiety over the years, to the point calling 911 for EMS because it felt like a heart attack. \xa0At its worse was about 5 years ago, I was experiencing bad dyskinesia, with my neurologist we tried adjusting my meds by lowering the dosage to help with dyskinesia, which it did, but completely put me into extreme anxiety attacks, I was hyperventilating, trouble getting my breath and fast panting breathing.\n‚ÄúAnxiety is a common non-motor symptom of PD. It is important to note that anxiety is not simply a reaction to the diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs, but is instead a part of the disease itself, caused by changes in the brain chemistry of the brain‚Äù, from this article about PD and anxiety, https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Symptoms/Non-Movement-Symptoms/Anxiety, so lowering my meds too much made the anxiety worse, my doctor put me on Lexapro antidepressant, which greatly helped.\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if possibly your mother needs to change the dose of her meds, ask the doctor about an antidepressant, or trying another type of med, like Rytary, which is a time release capsule. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since being put on Lexapro, it really helped me out. I know how bad it feels to be under the grip of anxiety, I feel for your mother, it‚Äôs like going out of your mind, but I think she can overcome this with the right PD med and antidepressant, she may have to try a few different options till she gets the help she needs. \xa0There is also the Neupro patch, which is a transdermal med applied once a day, working all day. \xa0I hope my experience helps in some way, but most important, don‚Äôt give up till she gets the help she nneed.\n'], ['\nHi, Steve.\n\xa0\nPlease allow me to add my 2 centavos. As others have mentioned, I think someone from your family has to work with your mother‚Äôs neurologist to find the best PD medicine and the correct dosage of this medicine. It is difficult for some of your compatriots in the US to translate their experiences to your mother‚Äôs location. One or more of your respondents have mentioned Rytary. For what it is worth, the drug has been a godsend for me.\xa0 It is a time-release version of carbidopa/levodopa and I find that it can last some time for 4-5 hours. There are a number of capsule strengths, and it took me some time to find the right dosage. As with many\xa0 PD meds, you and your Mom‚Äôs neurologist have to be flexible, willing to adjust the dosage. The major drawback of Rytary is its cost. I am fortunate. I have a great health plan, and I do not pay for Rytary at all. The ‚Äúlist‚Äù price that I see on my drug packages equates to an annual cost of $15,000.\nAs to her anxiety, some of the drugs being mentioned are quite potent, and I have not had too much success with most of them.\xa0 The SSRI‚Äôs (Zoloft, Lexipro, et.al.) were particularly harmful to me, driving me to think some terrible thoughts about my continued existence. Some people have had success with these drugs. I agree with others that adding physical exercise and mentally relaxing pursuits (tai chi, meditation) may be helpful. If it is decided to stop the strong psychotherapeutic drug, it must be done slowly.\nOne other thing. Have you ever looked at DBS (deep brain stimulation) as a treatment for her tremors? This technique is admittedly invasive and will make you cringe when you first hear the details of the technique. BUT, it works. There are neurosurgeons in the US who have become experts at using this procedure, and I imagine that the UK probably has them also. There is another treatment therapy that I would research if I were you. Go to sonimodul.ch . A researcher/doctor in Switzerland has been doing some amazing things with MRI guided ultrasound waves aimed at the most affected areas of the brain. This technique was invented in Israel, and the Swiss institute has been using it for some time. It‚Äôs called Exablate Neuro. My neurologist has urged me to wait a while before pursuing treatment because I do not suffer from tremors. The technique‚Äôs track record with non-tremor aspects of PD is not as developed.\n\xa0\nHope you are able to help your mother improve.\n\xa0\nRegards,\n\xa0\nSteve\n'], ['\nHello Mr. Steve\nPermission to share about my experience with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, I was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs age of 20 years. During my time with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, I also felt that some drugs made non-motor symptoms appear. Some non-motor symptoms are anxiety and depression. I do not really know whether this is indeed a reaction from chemicals in the brain due to Parkinson‚Äôs Disease or there are some drugs that can cause non-motor symptoms. For my non-motor symptoms that I convey to the neurologist, my neurologist said that it can indeed trigger anxiety, stress, and several other non-motor symptoms. Then, my neurologist gave me some medicines for non-motor symptoms, if in Indonesia I was given Setraline, and Resperidon. My non-motor symptoms, I also try to reduce it by walking on the porch, reading books, interacting with friends, humor and so on. For me personally the symptoms can be controlled because the treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease requires comprehensive treatment.\nHopefully the current situation improves soon and all of you friends can move normally and as usual. Stay Universe and be positive\nRegards,\nArgya Bayuaji\n'], ['\nHi and thanks very much to all of you for taking the time to reply with your thoughts, advice and best wishes. It is very much appreciated.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n@Phil, my mum does have my dad with her who is doing a great job of looing after her and luckily is in good shape so has no problems in that respect.\nI agree re the neurologist and doctor being the ones who need to advise re the meds but unfortunately, she still, after 6 months or so of being on various medications does not seem to be improving with the anxiety being a big part of the problem it seems.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n@Jean ‚Äì Thanks for your kind words. Re my mum‚Äôs mobility it‚Äôs not great as she also has issues with her knees and had a partial knee replacement a year or two back which was semi-successful so that doesn‚Äôt help with the mobility. She is 72.\nThe Rock Steady Boxing looks like fun. I fancy it myself!!! Maybe it would do my mum some good to punch out some of her frustration üôÇ She currently uses an exercise bike but not as often as she probably should.\nI will pass that suggestion and the Dance for PD suggestion on to my parents. The only thing re that type of activity at the moment (apart from Covid-19) is that she does not feel well enough to go out really or even have visitors.\nThanks also for the book reference. I will look to get a copy of that.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n @Marlene ‚Äì Thanks for all of your advice and insight too. Following your post, I mentioned the anti-depressant option to my father (who I speak to more than my mother). I‚Äôm pretty sure she is not on any at the moment, so it is worth looking in to. It seems that the medication for anxiety is not working.\nAlso totally agree are the exercise and classes which in my opinion are a great way of getting exercise as they are more enjoyable and motivating than just trying to exercise on your own. The hurdle here will be to get my mum to get involved.\nIt‚Äôs great to hear too that you have managed to improve your quality of life significantly since 2013. I hope you continue to enjoy life and that we all get to travel again in the not too distant future.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n@Russ ‚Äì Thanks a lot for the suggestion. Certainly worth looking into.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n @Laura ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your experience. It also looks to be similar to my mothers in various ways. They have been and are trying various combinations of meds, some of which seem to make her feel worse it seems and she therefore is tempted to give up on them after a short while but as Phil mentioned above I think she needs to be more patient with some.\nWhen you mention ‚Äúit‚Äôs like going out of your mind‚Äù, that is certainly a feeling that I think she is suffering from.\nI see you again mention anti-depressants, so this looks like it is definitely worth investigating, as are your other suggestions.\nMy dad mentioned that a couple of weeks ago she seemed to go catatonic (wasn‚Äôt moving, just staring into space) for a long period of time one morning which the doctors put down to a severe panic attack so again looks to be similar to what you and others are describing.\nThanks again, and we won¬¥t give up üôÇ\n‚Äî‚Äî-\n@Steve ‚Äì Again, many thanks for your insights and advice. All of this is certainly going to give my father and I something to think about and explore.\nThe time release option sounds interesting (Rytary). It seems that the PD drug that my mother is currently on (Madopar) works for her for about 90 minutes and then she has a bad 2 hours or so until the next dose so that upsets her too as she knows she‚Äôs only going to feel better for a short period of time. I think she takes a slow-release version of the drug at night before she goes to bed but basically does not seem to get that much relief from the PD symptoms and has to take sleeping pills otherwise the shaking keeps her awake.\nRe the DBS and focused ultrasound, we are aware of those procedures and will probably look into them further as the Covid-19 situation improves. The shaking is a very big problem for my mother and one of the things which seems to cause a lot of her anxiety.\n‚Äî‚Äî-\n@Argya ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your experience. It seems that the balance of the correct drugs is the key as the fight is against both the PD and anxiety/depression and at the same time It does seem that my mum needs to try and persist with some form of exercise and more interaction with other people. Both my father and I do notice that she perks up when we have a skype conversation and gets to speak a little with her grandchildren here in Spain but she does not seem to really want to interact with others at the moment.\n‚Äî‚Äî-\nI want to thank you all once again for your kind input and advice. I don‚Äôt interact too much on-line (even though I¬¥m in IT) but this has been an amazingly positive experience thanks to your willingness to share your own experiences, knowledge and time.\nI certainly think that the information that you have shared provides us with some interesting areas to follow up on.\nI wish you all the best for the future and hope you are all managing to keep safe through these difficult times.\nI will be sure to let you know how my mother gets on.\n'], ['\nHi, Steve,\nMy uncle‚Äôs situation is quite different from your Mom‚Äôs ‚Äî he has been developmentally disabled since age 5 due to an anesthesia error, during a childhood surgery, he has lived with PD for 18 years, and his PD is now accompanied by full-blown PD-related dementia ‚Äî so it is entirely possible what I post here will be utterly irrelevant for you. I‚Äôm going to post it anyway, though, because of the surprising help he‚Äôs gotten with anxiety the past few months.\nUntil about a year ago, his symptoms tracked with the ebb and flow of his Rytary (and before that, Stalevo) dosages. In the past year, however, it has become much more complicated to track his symptoms; they are a mix of purely physical and largely psychological. He tenses up, gets obsessive about being taken for a car ride, starts shaking, and often spends the rest of the day severely ‚Äòoff‚Äô and unresponsive to subsequent Rytary doses. Passive relaxation aids (guiding his breathing, heavy blanket, heating pad, soft music, etc.) help (very) occasionally, but in general he does not have the awareness or concentration to use active relaxation methods.\nWe\xa0 readanecdotal accounts that many PD patients were responding well to TouchPoints, wristwatch-like gadgets that create alternating vibrations on each wrist in a relaxing rhythm. It was a one-time purchase, would not affect any pharmacological balances, and seemed to address the psychological arousal we thought we were seeing, so we bought and tried them.\nThey‚Äôve been shockingly effective. If the caregiver recognizes the early stages of anxiety and puts them on his wrists, he avoids the ‚Äòoff‚Äô periods ~85% of the time. Occasionally, maybe a third of the time, they‚Äôll even pull him out of a crash (our term for his severe off periods) that is already underway.\nI wouldn‚Äôt bother posting, given how different the context of his symptoms is from your Mom‚Äôs, but anxiety being front and center of your post makes me think it is worth sharing. If you want to look into it, searching ‚ÄúTouchpoints for Parkinson‚Äôs‚Äù ought to work.\n\xa0\nJoel\n'], ['\nHi Joel,\nThanks for sharing yours and your uncle‚Äôs experience.

And does it get easier to regulate medications as you become more attuned to the disease?\n'], ['\nJust an interesting question. I think you can answer this by your self.\n'], ['\nHi Mary Beth, Hope your Dad is doing well.\nI chose to take medication right after my formal diagnosis.  It was obvious that I had had Parkinson‚Äôs long before.  My neurologist also thought it was in my best interest to start right away and I am glad I did.  I had almost immediate relief.  Although my medication has changed a few times last year I think I have the right mix at present. But only for present not for future.

I think it is a given that my medications will keep changing.\n'], ['\nHere are some thoughts on why regulating\xa0 Parkinson‚Äôs medications can be tricky:\n1. Parkinson‚Äôs is a progressive disease, so over time medications will have to be increased. But the most effective increase is not obvious, Do\xa0 you increase dopamine (Cd/Ld), add a dopamine agonist to make the Cd/Ld work better, or add an MAO-B\xa0 like rasagiline to slow the breakdown of\xa0 dopamine?\n2. It‚Äôs easy to forget that\xa0 you must wait at least an hour after eating before you take your Cd/Ld. Preferred is to take your first dose when\xa0 you get up, so you‚Äôll\xa0 have an empty stomach, then wait an hour before breakfast. But then there are lunch and dinner. I‚Äôm taking 5 doses a day, at 6, 10, 2, 6, and 10. Do you see the problem? The 2 pm and 6 pm are regularly taken too close to meal time, and a protein slug at lunch or dinner pretty much knocks to Cd/Ld.\n3. If your bowels are plugged with junk (that is, if you are constipated), the absorption of the Cd/Ld in the intestine inhibited.\n4. In some Parkies, exercise can burn off dopamine, putting the Parky into an off period.\nIn other words, titrating\xa0 your meds is\xa0 shooting at a moving target.\nLastly, half the time I get a refill, the pills (always generic) are made by any one of several different manufacturers, mostly in India. Since the FDA allows a rather wide range of potency in\xa0 a drug as long as it has ‚Äúbioequivalency,‚Äù you might be getting a slightly different potency with every refill.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nGood question Mary Beth\nHello to Robert Harris from another member of the ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù clan.\xa0\xa0 My son is the sixth Robert in our family tree (we do change the middle names, so no Roman Numerals after our names.).\nWe seem to share a lot on this PD journey.\xa0 I too take pills 5 or six times a day and seem to have been issued the same ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù system that you describe.\xa0 And I too show evidence that PD bowel problems can interfere with Sinemet absorption.\nOne difference so far is that my doctors have an overall theme that PD is a dopamine deficiency disease.\xa0 PD people need more dopamine.\xa0 That‚Äôs the only med I take directly for the PD.\xa0 2 regular pills 5 times a day plus some overriding extended release pills on top of the regular doses and 2 extended release at bedtime.\xa0 They have told me that the other Parkinson‚Äôs pills have too many side effects and after tying them over the years, they avoid them.\xa0 I do take a medication for low blood pressure which is a feature of my PD.\xa0 I am in my 15th months of taking any meds.

Every 6 months my doctor, Dr. Tsao-Wei Liang, Jefferson University‚Äôs Movement Disorders Center of Excellence, makes any adjustments needed to address current PD symptoms.\xa0 Though not all symptoms are impacted by DBS, the surgery made it possible for me to improve some major symptoms, which affected my attitude and motivation to address the remaining existing symptoms.\nWhatever course of treatment you choose, I recommend educating yourself as much as you can about that treatment, asking questions of your doctor.\xa0 Prepare for each doctor‚Äôs visit with:\xa0 medication history, including physical and emotional reactions to any new or increased medications;\xa0 changes in physical symptoms, and address any emotional issues.

It has been a game changer! Completely stopped the trembling the moment they turned on the transmitter.\nIt doesn‚Äôt have a big affect on any other symptoms, maybe a little on freezing gait or draggy foot, and some on trembling in his chin, but they told us it was mostly for the arms/hands/trembling which were his primary symptoms at that time. It works like a charm. When we have to turn it off for an EKG we see just how serious his trembling really is without DBS!\nFirst he had to pass the intense battery of tests to qualify for the surgery at Emory, everything from a brain scan to a cognition test. The surgery itself was NINE HOURS under anesthesia. So he was really, really tired for a long time. And we didn‚Äôt understand our role in that recovery because they discharged him at noon the next day. After brain surgery! And I stupidly drove him home (a 2 hour ride) while he felt totally miserable. The second time we went back to the hotel and I tucked him into bed where he slept off and on for the next 24 hours before he felt like making the ride home.\nThe first time he had monster headaches for a few weeks after the surgery because they drill a hole in your skull to get the wires into your brain. After the second surgery, there were no headaches, so we aren‚Äôt really sure what was different. It was a three step process. (1) Hole in skull ‚Äì\xa0 inserted the wires into his brain (used image-guided approach because his head was too big for the halo method). (2) Two weeks later they ran the wires down the back of his neck (under the skin, but you can still feel the hump of the wires) and into the front of his upper chest to attach to the transmitter that is implanted in the chest cavity. (3) After incision heals a bit, go see neurologist to turn on the transmitter. His hands stopped trembling IMMEDIATELY. I was in tears.\nHis hands don‚Äôt tremble at all now. And if there‚Äôs a little break-through trembling occasionally we can go up a notch (at home, with our remote) to control this. A useful tool as we face constant progression of the disease to keep him independent as long as possible. We see the neurologist twice a year for transmitter check-ups. He‚Äôs going great for a 77 year old. Mobility is another challenge, and speech and swallowing are intermittent obstacles, but we deal with it. They are not helped by DBS. But he can hold a cup of coffee, surf the Internet, brush his teeth, use an IPad, write his name, feed himself, dress himself, etc. Without DBS all of that would be out of reach, literally and figuratively.\nTips ‚Äì battery transmitters last a couple of years and then have to be replaced in the chest. Outpatient surgery. Depends on how high your settings are as to how long they last. After one replacement cycle the next time we opted for rechargeable transmitters and have to hook him up like a cell phone couple times a week for an hour or two. Not convenient, but a world of difference from the trembling that would exist without it.\nGood luck with your journey!\n'], ['Posts']]"

I have been using the 4mg/24hr patch for about a year now and it has produced no side effects as far as I can tell‚ÄìParkinson‚Äôs itself and the other meds for it cause side effects such as\xa0 constipation, so it‚Äôs hard to separate.\nPersonal use and experience: Take the advice not to put the patch on a skin area that contains hair. The patch adhesive is quite strong, even pulling it from a hairless area is rather unpleasant. My neurologist has me put the patch on at 10 pm and take off at 6 am, to help what he thinks is RLS (restless leg syndrome), but which I think is spinal myoclonus. Also, a bit of a headache is that the same skin area cannot be used again for two weeks, meaning that you have to identify and track 14 places on your body that you will visit sequentially every two weeks.\nThe Neupro patch does seem to help a little. Sometimes when I forget to put it on, I sleep the same way as when I had stuck it on. Other times, I think I do sense that it is doing something.\nSo far, good. I‚Äôve had bad experience with dopamine agonists. Before I was clearly diagnosed with PD, I went to a doctor who prescribed Requip (rpiniriole), which caused me to nearly lose consciousness at work. A few months later, I was prescribed Mirapex (pramipexole) 2.5 mg/ tid and I almost fell asleep while driving. After some research, I read that studies have shown that 1 mg/tid provides the most therapeutic dose and that more doesn‚Äôt help. So I stayed on it for along time, then reduced it to 1mg at bedtime to function as sleep aid. Finally, since it wasn‚Äôt doing much to help my insomnia, I quit that and now don‚Äôt take any praimipexole.\n[Remember that you cannot generalize from one Parky to another, and that you should consult a neurologist\xa0 specializing in movement disorders / Parkinsonism before making any changes.]\n'], ['\nI have been on Neupro for several years.\xa0 My movement disorder neurologist started me at 1mg and ramped me up to 8mg which I have used for at least 4 or 5 years.\xa0 Also 7.5 tabs/day of Sinemet, 1mg Azilect (rasagiline) and Amantadine (2/day).\xa0 No side effects from the Neupro.\xa0 My understanding of Neupro‚Äôs advantage is a more even availability, over time,\xa0 in the body than oral agonists.\xa0 Only two downsides:\xa0 Even with Medicare Part D it is very very pricey.\xa0 Also, you need to develop a chart for placement or you get itchy dermatitis.\xa0 (e.g:\xa0 Monday ‚Äìleft arm, upper, front; tuesday left arm, lower , front‚Ä¶etc.)\xa0 or you can use the chart on the manufacturer‚Äôs website).\xa0 I have a seven day rotation schedule.\xa0 The mfg recommends 14 days.\xa0 My neurologist says in my case the arms work better than other locations.\xa0 8mg patches use\xa0 a lot of real-estate.\xa0 Remember:\xa0 ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply to us ‚ÄúParkies‚Äù.\n'], ['\nMy neurologist is anxious for me to try Neupro, because my chief complaint is that I am deeply affected, both physically and mentally, when I enter those terrible ‚Äúoff‚Äù\xa0 periods when my Rytary does not work as well as it should. Neupro, with its mechanism for continuous dose dispensing, should in theory help me avoid those ‚Äúoff‚Äù episodes. But , as others have already mentioned, most people on Neupro continue to take a form of levidopa, albeit at a smaller dose. I also wonder how well the patch will adhere to my skin once the humid weather of SW Florida makes its appearance. Will the patch stay in place, and what about when I go swimming in the Gulf?\nTruth is that my having added a ‚Äúbooster‚Äù dose of Rytary in the afternoon is helping me avoid those awful late afternoon ‚Äúoff‚Äù periods for the most part. So, right now (I want to speak softly so that I do not disturb the PD gods), I don‚Äôt have enough of a negative experience to push me into trying another drug.\nI have a new friend that has made an appearance ‚Äì cervical dystonia. Oh, joy!\n\xa0\n'], ['\nI am not a swimmer like Steven, so I don‚Äôt know about whether\xa0 the patch will stay in place while swimming, but it seems to be stable in the shower.\xa0 The key thing is to read thoroughly the instructions in the box.\xa0 The instructions are probably on\xa0 the Teva (the manufacturer) website too.\nI try to find skin that is not wrinkled, make sure the patch goes on evenly and press firmly for about a minute.\xa0 Also affix the patch when the skin is dry.\xa0 I think the patch has a 26 or 28 hour life, so be sure to do it at the same time each day.\n'], ['\nG‚Äôday Scott and all the other Parkinson‚Äôs Warriors in this string\nI have been using Neupro 8 mg patches for about 6 months and i shower sometimes multiple times a day,  have swum in swimming pools and in the surf and been tropical/humid environments and dry/cold environments.  To avoid the risk of the patch coming off, not likely in the shower unless not applied firmly,  I tape it on with strong waterproof tape or get one of those waterproof cover seal patches to put over it to keep it dry and on.\nYou are fortunate you are being advised patches and a reduction in levodopa i have gone other way doubled the levodopa/carbidopa 250/25 mg and now looking at 16 mg patches and doing an apomorphine test on the 21st of this month to assess to either increasing oral/patch meds or having a dopamine pump.  All because my off days come more frequently, last longer, are more severe, and take longer to recover from. So for my own sanity and that of my wonderful fiancee, who is also my primary caregiver who still works 12 hrs a day 5 days a week and to relieve the concerns and frustration of brilliant MS Neurologist we all know we have to do something rather severe and soon.\nI have had no problems with the patches as long I place them on air dry, wrinkle free skin like outer edge of shoulder and top of thigh. I find it also helps if you shave those areas occasionally as the patches seem to stick better.  Also when you remove the patch rubbing some tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil on the place where the patch was removes any residual adhesive and helps avoid any irritation, reactions or itchiness that may occur during or after you remove the patch.  And don‚Äôt forget to rotate around 4 or 5 different places on your body every morning when you apply, repetitive placements on the same place for multiple days can cause some really nasty irritations.\nGood luck with the Neupro Patches and I really hope they do the trick for you.  Best Wishes Andy\n'], ['\nHas anybody noticed a difference in the efficacy of the patch when it‚Äôs placed on different locations of the body? It was possibly a coincidence, but I was sticking it on my thighs for about a week, and truly had a terrible week. The day I switched it on to my arm, I had a much better day. I tried to figure out what was different from the previous week, and the only thing I could pin down was the patch location. Any thoughts on this would be welcome!\n'], ['\nHi I was prescribed the patch bit felt terrible after 3 days and removed it. Instantly better, but the core problems remain.

LOL.\nDavid ‚Äì I felt terrible when I started the patch as well. What I ended up doing (after ripping it off after one day of almost total shut-down), was I weaned myself on to the patch, just using half a patch a day, plus reduced my dopamine to pre-dyskenisia dosage (all on Dr.s orders, of course). So now, after two months I feel OK, but I can‚Äôt honestly say my tremor or stiffness is any better. I still feel like I need more dopamine. I think I notice it the most with my sleeping, which is to say I mostly sleep through the night instead of tossing and turning for a couple of hours each night like I used to. Also my dyskinesia is gone. My insurance does not cover it, so I am \xa0debating whether it is worth the price ($122/month).\nMy plan at this point is to wait a bit longer, hopefully get back to my ‚Äònormal‚Äô level of exercise when the gyms open again, and see what unfolds in the next 2-3 months.\nThanks for sharing.\n\xa0\n'], ['Posts']]"

June 2017 diagnosed with Parkinsons\n2. Consultant prescribed Rasagaline (with Madopar/Sinemet to follow later)\n3. 2017- April 2019 continued as per 2\n4. April 2019-June 2019 started Madopar 50/12.5Mg no benefit (consultant queried Parkinsons diagnosis) some side effects discontinued Madopar\n5. July 2019 CT scan all clear no abnormalities\n6. August 2019 anxiety becomes a problem commence meds (Pregabalin)\n7. December 2019 anxiety worse Pregabalin increased 100Mg x 3 times/day.\n8. December 2019 Dat scan requested ,anxiety much worse . Madopar 50/12.5Mg restarted. x 3 doses per day\n9. January 2020 Dat scan ,severe dopamine deficit Parkinsons confirmed. Madopar increased 100/25Mg x 4 doses per day\n10. February 2020 Madopar increased 150/37.5Mg x 4 doses/day\n11. March 2020 Anxiety very bad Pregabalin continues as per 7 no apparent improvement\nIt was around June last year that all of the family was with her (myself, wife and children) and she at that point was not too bad. We actually live in Spain so I/we dont see that much of her unfortunately. For some months now she hasn¬¥t really wanted visitors at all. My father lives with her in the UK.\nSince last June however she seems to have gone down hill quite quickly and as mentioned above in January this year her DAT Scan showed severe dopamine deficiency. She mainly had the DAT scan as the Madopar did not seem to be helping her much and follwing the DAT scan the dosage was increased. She is now on a dosage of 150/37.5Mg x 4 doses/day.\nShe is also suffering with quite bad anxiety for which she is taking Pregabalin.\nUnfortunately the Pregabalin does not seem to be decreasing her anxiety much and the Madopar only seems to work for an hour or so although she only has been taking the current dosage since February.\nThe thing that causes alot of anxiety and seems to stress her the most is the shaking which she has on both sides of her body. As I understand stress and anxiety can worsen the tremor so its a bit catch 22.\nIt seems that the anxiety is really affecting her at the moment perhaps as much as the PD with regards to her general state and quality of life.\nSo‚Ä¶.I am wondering if others have had a similar experience and if anyone can offer any advice.\nThanks in advance for any comments and I hope you are all managing to take care of yourselves and stay safe in the current situation that we all find ourselves.\n'], ['\nHello, Steve.\nI‚Äôm a person with PD.\xa0 I‚Äôm blessed to have my wife as my care partner.\xa0 My PD is in early stages yet, and my neurologist and my primary doctor have treated my wife as an important team member from the start.\xa0 Sometimes, it‚Äôs no more than a squeeze of my hand or an arm around the shoulder.\xa0 She hears my watch beeping before I do, and reminds me it‚Äôs time for my med‚Äôs.\xa0 She has been with me on every appointment, and we discuss every change or sign of progression.\xa0 So we‚Äôre on a good foundation for what the future brings.\nWith you in Spain and your mother in the UK, I really don‚Äôt know how to advise.\xa0 Your mother needs a care partner by her side, and I hope it‚Äôs not too late for someone to take on that role.\xa0 Is your father being a care partner for her?\nAnd it‚Äôs really the neurologist and the doctor together that need to advise on meds and dosage.\nPatience is key.\xa0 PD is something that will go on changing, as you‚Äôve already experienced, and change is liable to be hard for your mother.\nI don‚Äôt want to sound judgmental, but this is really from my heart.\xa0 We‚Äôre wishing you and your family all the best as you search for solutions,\nPhil\n'], ['\nHI Steve,\nit sounds as though your Mom is having a tough time.\xa0 \xa0I am sorry for her struggles.\xa0 You are a good son, trying to do the best for your Mom and I am sure she must\xa0 take comfort in that.\xa0 You didnt say how old she\xa0 is or what her mobility is like, but, I have found exercise to be the BEST thing for Parkinson‚Äôs and more and more doctors are stressing this.\xa0 Rock Steady Boxing is the best thing to ever happen to me and many others with PD.\xa0 I have seen people come in with a walker and extreme lack of mobility on their own, and after a few months of classes 2x/week, they were able to forego their walker.\xa0 \xa0The classes are for people with PD only and all levels of ability.\xa0 there are a few in UK, Glasgow, Widnes and Wirral.\xa0 here is a link:\xa0 https://rocksteadyboxing.org/find-a-class/#go_here\n\xa0\nDance for PD is also an excellent program and they have online classes that can be taken:\xa0 https://danceforparkinsons.org\nI don‚Äôt know anything about Madopar or Pregabalin so I cannot comment on them.\xa0 One thing for sure, PD manifests itself differently in everyone, both in terms of rate of progression and what therapies will work or not work.\nI am not a health professional so I can only speak from my experiences.\xa0 Bottom line, I believe movement and exercise are the best things to combat stress, anxiety, PD symptoms and PD progression.\xa0 \xa0I do take carbidopa/levodopa and selegeline so that I can exercise.\xa0 \xa0 I wish you luck and hope for the best for your Mom.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nSteve, I did a little research on Madopar.\xa0 Apparently that is a brand name for benserazide/levodopa.\xa0 \xa0It seems in Europe, benserazide is used while carbidopa is used in the USA with levodopa .\xa0 \xa0The function of both benserazide and carbidopa is the same; helps to prevent nausea caused by premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain.\xa0 I have found with this disease, that one must be proactive (the caregiver and person with PD) and must educate themselves.\xa0 I have found a book, The New Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Treatment Book (2015 edition) by Dr. Eric Ahlskog to be a great reference book\n'], ['\nHi Steve,\nI‚Äôm sorry your mom is having such a rough time.\xa0 I was diagnosed in Jan. 2011, and the summer of 2013 was absolutely my worst time, so I hope my response will provide some encouragement.\xa0 I see that your mom is on anti-anxiety meds (so am I), but I don‚Äôt see an anti-depressant in your information.\xa0 I started taking the lowest dosage of Venlafaxine XR capsules during that summer of 2013, and that was the first step to getting my life back.\xa0 It does take something like six weeks to be effective, but for me it was totally worth it.\nThe next step, and on this I totally agree with Jean, was to get involved in exercise classes that my local hospital offers.\xa0 I started with T‚Äôai Chi, then added Beginner‚Äôs Yoga, and then added an exercise class.\xa0 These classes are for those of us over 65, and most of us in fact have some condition which may well call for a modification of some of the activities, which is considered fine.\xa0 I have been doing these three classes for years (Right now, of course, we are not having classes because of Covid-19, but some of the classes are starting to be reactivated with the help of Zoom so we can follow these online while we are at home.), and they have given me my life back!\xa0 I never would have expected, at 73, to be going to classes like these, but they are so much fun, I have met so many people who have become friends, and I have regained balance, flexibility, and stamina.\nI do also follow many PD support programs and groups online, and one thing I read recently was that there seems to be little correlation to the amount of tremor one has and to the quality of life, but that there is a huge correlation to loneliness and quality of life with PD.\xa0 I\xa0 certainly believe this is true.\xa0 Your mom may not be receptive to going to a class like this, but have your dad check out what is available and then gently suggest that she tries one.\xa0 Libraries as well as hospitals by me offer inexpensive programs like this, and though I have not been able to find one of the programs that are specifically for those with PD, for me that has not been a problem.\nI do deal with anxiety fairly often, so I always have my anti-anxiety meds with me, but I find that when I am out and having a good time with my friends I hardly ever need them at that time.\nI remember how I was in the summer of 2013, and that person did not believe that a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù kind of life would ever be possible again.\xa0 Since then, my husband and I have traveled around the US as well as taking some international trips.\xa0 For me life is good ‚Äì sometimes a bit challenging, but an adventure that I am happy to take.\xa0 I wish that for your mom!\n'], ['\nButyric acid supplements, have her try them. They worked for me in reversing my PD. Anxiety is also gone.\n'], ['\nHi Steve, I‚Äôve dealt with severe anxiety over the years, to the point calling 911 for EMS because it felt like a heart attack. \xa0At its worse was about 5 years ago, I was experiencing bad dyskinesia, with my neurologist we tried adjusting my meds by lowering the dosage to help with dyskinesia, which it did, but completely put me into extreme anxiety attacks, I was hyperventilating, trouble getting my breath and fast panting breathing.\n‚ÄúAnxiety is a common non-motor symptom of PD. It is important to note that anxiety is not simply a reaction to the diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs, but is instead a part of the disease itself, caused by changes in the brain chemistry of the brain‚Äù, from this article about PD and anxiety, https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Symptoms/Non-Movement-Symptoms/Anxiety, so lowering my meds too much made the anxiety worse, my doctor put me on Lexapro antidepressant, which greatly helped.\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if possibly your mother needs to change the dose of her meds, ask the doctor about an antidepressant, or trying another type of med, like Rytary, which is a time release capsule. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since being put on Lexapro, it really helped me out. I know how bad it feels to be under the grip of anxiety, I feel for your mother, it‚Äôs like going out of your mind, but I think she can overcome this with the right PD med and antidepressant, she may have to try a few different options till she gets the help she needs. \xa0There is also the Neupro patch, which is a transdermal med applied once a day, working all day. \xa0I hope my experience helps in some way, but most important, don‚Äôt give up till she gets the help she nneed.\n'], ['\nHi, Steve.\n\xa0\nPlease allow me to add my 2 centavos. As others have mentioned, I think someone from your family has to work with your mother‚Äôs neurologist to find the best PD medicine and the correct dosage of this medicine. It is difficult for some of your compatriots in the US to translate their experiences to your mother‚Äôs location. One or more of your respondents have mentioned Rytary. For what it is worth, the drug has been a godsend for me.\xa0 It is a time-release version of carbidopa/levodopa and I find that it can last some time for 4-5 hours. There are a number of capsule strengths, and it took me some time to find the right dosage. As with many\xa0 PD meds, you and your Mom‚Äôs neurologist have to be flexible, willing to adjust the dosage. The major drawback of Rytary is its cost. I am fortunate. I have a great health plan, and I do not pay for Rytary at all. The ‚Äúlist‚Äù price that I see on my drug packages equates to an annual cost of $15,000.\nAs to her anxiety, some of the drugs being mentioned are quite potent, and I have not had too much success with most of them.\xa0 The SSRI‚Äôs (Zoloft, Lexipro, et.al.) were particularly harmful to me, driving me to think some terrible thoughts about my continued existence. Some people have had success with these drugs. I agree with others that adding physical exercise and mentally relaxing pursuits (tai chi, meditation) may be helpful. If it is decided to stop the strong psychotherapeutic drug, it must be done slowly.\nOne other thing. Have you ever looked at DBS (deep brain stimulation) as a treatment for her tremors? This technique is admittedly invasive and will make you cringe when you first hear the details of the technique. BUT, it works. There are neurosurgeons in the US who have become experts at using this procedure, and I imagine that the UK probably has them also. There is another treatment therapy that I would research if I were you. Go to sonimodul.ch . A researcher/doctor in Switzerland has been doing some amazing things with MRI guided ultrasound waves aimed at the most affected areas of the brain. This technique was invented in Israel, and the Swiss institute has been using it for some time. It‚Äôs called Exablate Neuro. My neurologist has urged me to wait a while before pursuing treatment because I do not suffer from tremors. The technique‚Äôs track record with non-tremor aspects of PD is not as developed.\n\xa0\nHope you are able to help your mother improve.\n\xa0\nRegards,\n\xa0\nSteve\n'], ['\nHello Mr. Steve\nPermission to share about my experience with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, I was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs age of 20 years. During my time with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, I also felt that some drugs made non-motor symptoms appear. Some non-motor symptoms are anxiety and depression. I do not really know whether this is indeed a reaction from chemicals in the brain due to Parkinson‚Äôs Disease or there are some drugs that can cause non-motor symptoms. For my non-motor symptoms that I convey to the neurologist, my neurologist said that it can indeed trigger anxiety, stress, and several other non-motor symptoms. Then, my neurologist gave me some medicines for non-motor symptoms, if in Indonesia I was given Setraline, and Resperidon. My non-motor symptoms, I also try to reduce it by walking on the porch, reading books, interacting with friends, humor and so on. For me personally the symptoms can be controlled because the treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease requires comprehensive treatment.\nHopefully the current situation improves soon and all of you friends can move normally and as usual.

It is very much appreciated.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n@Phil, my mum does have my dad with her who is doing a great job of looing after her and luckily is in good shape so has no problems in that respect.\nI agree re the neurologist and doctor being the ones who need to advise re the meds but unfortunately, she still, after 6 months or so of being on various medications does not seem to be improving with the anxiety being a big part of the problem it seems.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n@Jean ‚Äì Thanks for your kind words. Re my mum‚Äôs mobility it‚Äôs not great as she also has issues with her knees and had a partial knee replacement a year or two back which was semi-successful so that doesn‚Äôt help with the mobility. She is 72.\nThe Rock Steady Boxing looks like fun. I fancy it myself!!! Maybe it would do my mum some good to punch out some of her frustration üôÇ She currently uses an exercise bike but not as often as she probably should.\nI will pass that suggestion and the Dance for PD suggestion on to my parents. The only thing re that type of activity at the moment (apart from Covid-19) is that she does not feel well enough to go out really or even have visitors.\nThanks also for the book reference. I will look to get a copy of that.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì\n @Marlene ‚Äì Thanks for all of your advice and insight too. Following your post, I mentioned the anti-depressant option to my father (who I speak to more than my mother). I‚Äôm pretty sure she is not on any at the moment, so it is worth looking in to. It seems that the medication for anxiety is not working.\nAlso totally agree are the exercise and classes which in my opinion are a great way of getting exercise as they are more enjoyable and motivating than just trying to exercise on your own. The hurdle here will be to get my mum to get involved.\nIt‚Äôs great to hear too that you have managed to improve your quality of life significantly since 2013. I hope you continue to enjoy life and that we all get to travel again in the not too distant future.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n@Russ ‚Äì Thanks a lot for the suggestion. Certainly worth looking into.\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî\n @Laura ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your experience. It also looks to be similar to my mothers in various ways. They have been and are trying various combinations of meds, some of which seem to make her feel worse it seems and she therefore is tempted to give up on them after a short while but as Phil mentioned above I think she needs to be more patient with some.\nWhen you mention ‚Äúit‚Äôs like going out of your mind‚Äù, that is certainly a feeling that I think she is suffering from.\nI see you again mention anti-depressants, so this looks like it is definitely worth investigating, as are your other suggestions.\nMy dad mentioned that a couple of weeks ago she seemed to go catatonic (wasn‚Äôt moving, just staring into space) for a long period of time one morning which the doctors put down to a severe panic attack so again looks to be similar to what you and others are describing.\nThanks again, and we won¬¥t give up üôÇ\n‚Äî‚Äî-\n@Steve ‚Äì Again, many thanks for your insights and advice. All of this is certainly going to give my father and I something to think about and explore.\nThe time release option sounds interesting (Rytary). It seems that the PD drug that my mother is currently on (Madopar) works for her for about 90 minutes and then she has a bad 2 hours or so until the next dose so that upsets her too as she knows she‚Äôs only going to feel better for a short period of time. I think she takes a slow-release version of the drug at night before she goes to bed but basically does not seem to get that much relief from the PD symptoms and has to take sleeping pills otherwise the shaking keeps her awake.\nRe the DBS and focused ultrasound, we are aware of those procedures and will probably look into them further as the Covid-19 situation improves. The shaking is a very big problem for my mother and one of the things which seems to cause a lot of her anxiety.\n‚Äî‚Äî-\n@Argya ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your experience. It seems that the balance of the correct drugs is the key as the fight is against both the PD and anxiety/depression and at the same time It does seem that my mum needs to try and persist with some form of exercise and more interaction with other people. Both my father and I do notice that she perks up when we have a skype conversation and gets to speak a little with her grandchildren here in Spain but she does not seem to really want to interact with others at the moment.\n‚Äî‚Äî-\nI want to thank you all once again for your kind input and advice. I don‚Äôt interact too much on-line (even though I¬¥m in IT) but this has been an amazingly positive experience thanks to your willingness to share your own experiences, knowledge and time.\nI certainly think that the information that you have shared provides us with some interesting areas to follow up on.\nI wish you all the best for the future and hope you are all managing to keep safe through these difficult times.\nI will be sure to let you know how my mother gets on.\n'], ['\nHi, Steve,\nMy uncle‚Äôs situation is quite different from your Mom‚Äôs ‚Äî he has been developmentally disabled since age 5 due to an anesthesia error, during a childhood surgery, he has lived with PD for 18 years, and his PD is now accompanied by full-blown PD-related dementia ‚Äî so it is entirely possible what I post here will be utterly irrelevant for you. I‚Äôm going to post it anyway, though, because of the surprising help he‚Äôs gotten with anxiety the past few months.\nUntil about a year ago, his symptoms tracked with the ebb and flow of his Rytary (and before that, Stalevo) dosages. In the past year, however, it has become much more complicated to track his symptoms; they are a mix of purely physical and largely psychological. He tenses up, gets obsessive about being taken for a car ride, starts shaking, and often spends the rest of the day severely ‚Äòoff‚Äô and unresponsive to subsequent Rytary doses. Passive relaxation aids (guiding his breathing, heavy blanket, heating pad, soft music, etc.) help (very) occasionally, but in general he does not have the awareness or concentration to use active relaxation methods.\nWe\xa0 readanecdotal accounts that many PD patients were responding well to TouchPoints, wristwatch-like gadgets that create alternating vibrations on each wrist in a relaxing rhythm. It was a one-time purchase, would not affect any pharmacological balances, and seemed to address the psychological arousal we thought we were seeing, so we bought and tried them.\nThey‚Äôve been shockingly effective. If the caregiver recognizes the early stages of anxiety and puts them on his wrists, he avoids the ‚Äòoff‚Äô periods ~85% of the time. Occasionally, maybe a third of the time, they‚Äôll even pull him out of a crash (our term for his severe off periods) that is already underway.\nI wouldn‚Äôt bother posting, given how different the context of his symptoms is from your Mom‚Äôs, but anxiety being front and center of your post makes me think it is worth sharing. If you want to look into it, searching ‚ÄúTouchpoints for Parkinson‚Äôs‚Äù ought to work.\n\xa0\nJoel\n'], ['\nHi Joel,\nThanks for sharing yours and your uncle‚Äôs experience.

And since it‚Äôs an ever-changing process, our needs seem to shift with time.\nWhat is it that makes treating PD symptoms so complicated? Do you ever feel like you‚Äôve found a good balance? And does it get easier to regulate medications as you become more attuned to the disease?\n'], ['\nJust an interesting question. I think you can answer this by your self.\n'], ['\nHi Mary Beth, Hope your Dad is doing well.\nI chose to take medication right after my formal diagnosis.  It was obvious that I had had Parkinson‚Äôs long before.  My neurologist also thought it was in my best interest to start right away and I am glad I did.  I had almost immediate relief.  Although my medication has changed a few times last year I think I have the right mix at present. But only for present not for future. I think regulating is tricky is because things keep changing;  symptoms, on and off times, progression etc. Parkinson‚Äôs itself is very tricky and it follows that regulating medications would also be an issue. I think it is a given that my medications will keep changing.\n'], ['\nHere are some thoughts on why regulating\xa0 Parkinson‚Äôs medications can be tricky:\n1. Parkinson‚Äôs is a progressive disease, so over time medications will have to be increased. But the most effective increase is not obvious, Do\xa0 you increase dopamine (Cd/Ld), add a dopamine agonist to make the Cd/Ld work better, or add an MAO-B\xa0 like rasagiline to slow the breakdown of\xa0 dopamine?\n2. It‚Äôs easy to forget that\xa0 you must wait at least an hour after eating before you take your Cd/Ld. Preferred is to take your first dose when\xa0 you get up, so you‚Äôll\xa0 have an empty stomach, then wait an hour before breakfast. But then there are lunch and dinner. I‚Äôm taking 5 doses a day, at 6, 10, 2, 6, and 10. Do you see the problem? The 2 pm and 6 pm are regularly taken too close to meal time, and a protein slug at lunch or dinner pretty much knocks to Cd/Ld.\n3. If your bowels are plugged with junk (that is, if you are constipated), the absorption of the Cd/Ld in the intestine inhibited.\n4. In some Parkies, exercise can burn off dopamine, putting the Parky into an off period.\nIn other words, titrating\xa0 your meds is\xa0 shooting at a moving target.\nLastly, half the time I get a refill, the pills (always generic) are made by any one of several different manufacturers, mostly in India. Since the FDA allows a rather wide range of potency in\xa0 a drug as long as it has ‚Äúbioequivalency,‚Äù you might be getting a slightly different potency with every refill.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nGood question Mary Beth\nHello to Robert Harris from another member of the ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù clan.\xa0\xa0 My son is the sixth Robert in our family tree (we do change the middle names, so no Roman Numerals after our names.).\nWe seem to share a lot on this PD journey.\xa0 I too take pills 5 or six times a day and seem to have been issued the same ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù system that you describe.\xa0 And I too show evidence that PD bowel problems can interfere with Sinemet absorption.\nOne difference so far is that my doctors have an overall theme that PD is a dopamine deficiency disease.\xa0 PD people need more dopamine.\xa0 That‚Äôs the only med I take directly for the PD.\xa0 2 regular pills 5 times a day plus some overriding extended release pills on top of the regular doses and 2 extended release at bedtime.\xa0 They have told me that the other Parkinson‚Äôs pills have too many side effects and after tying them over the years, they avoid them.\xa0 I do take a medication for low blood pressure which is a feature of my PD.\xa0 I am in my 15th months of taking any meds.

It has been a game changer! Completely stopped the trembling the moment they turned on the transmitter.\nIt doesn‚Äôt have a big affect on any other symptoms, maybe a little on freezing gait or draggy foot, and some on trembling in his chin, but they told us it was mostly for the arms/hands/trembling which were his primary symptoms at that time. It works like a charm. When we have to turn it off for an EKG we see just how serious his trembling really is without DBS!\nFirst he had to pass the intense battery of tests to qualify for the surgery at Emory, everything from a brain scan to a cognition test. The surgery itself was NINE HOURS under anesthesia. So he was really, really tired for a long time. And we didn‚Äôt understand our role in that recovery because they discharged him at noon the next day. After brain surgery! And I stupidly drove him home (a 2 hour ride) while he felt totally miserable. The second time we went back to the hotel and I tucked him into bed where he slept off and on for the next 24 hours before he felt like making the ride home.\nThe first time he had monster headaches for a few weeks after the surgery because they drill a hole in your skull to get the wires into your brain. After the second surgery, there were no headaches, so we aren‚Äôt really sure what was different. It was a three step process. (1) Hole in skull ‚Äì\xa0 inserted the wires into his brain (used image-guided approach because his head was too big for the halo method). (2) Two weeks later they ran the wires down the back of his neck (under the skin, but you can still feel the hump of the wires) and into the front of his upper chest to attach to the transmitter that is implanted in the chest cavity. (3) After incision heals a bit, go see neurologist to turn on the transmitter. His hands stopped trembling IMMEDIATELY. I was in tears.\nHis hands don‚Äôt tremble at all now. And if there‚Äôs a little break-through trembling occasionally we can go up a notch (at home, with our remote) to control this. A useful tool as we face constant progression of the disease to keep him independent as long as possible. We see the neurologist twice a year for transmitter check-ups. He‚Äôs going great for a 77 year old. Mobility is another challenge, and speech and swallowing are intermittent obstacles, but we deal with it. They are not helped by DBS. But he can hold a cup of coffee, surf the Internet, brush his teeth, use an IPad, write his name, feed himself, dress himself, etc. Without DBS all of that would be out of reach, literally and figuratively.\nTips ‚Äì battery transmitters last a couple of years and then have to be replaced in the chest. Outpatient surgery. Depends on how high your settings are as to how long they last. After one replacement cycle the next time we opted for rechargeable transmitters and have to hook him up like a cell phone couple times a week for an hour or two. Not convenient, but a world of difference from the trembling that would exist without it.\nGood luck with your journey!\n'], ['Posts']]"

The difference is that Neupro is a patch that releases the medicine onto the skin, where the medicine then passes through the skin (transdermal) and is absorbed into the body.\nThe monograph accompanying the product contains the usual precautions, including nausea, vomiting, sleepiness, dizziness, in the 10 to 15% range for the 4mg/24hr patch. I have been using the 4mg/24hr patch for about a year now and it has produced no side effects as far as I can tell‚ÄìParkinson‚Äôs itself and the other meds for it cause side effects such as\xa0 constipation, so it‚Äôs hard to separate.\nPersonal use and experience: Take the advice not to put the patch on a skin area that contains hair. The patch adhesive is quite strong, even pulling it from a hairless area is rather unpleasant. My neurologist has me put the patch on at 10 pm and take off at 6 am, to help what he thinks is RLS (restless leg syndrome), but which I think is spinal myoclonus. Also, a bit of a headache is that the same skin area cannot be used again for two weeks, meaning that you have to identify and track 14 places on your body that you will visit sequentially every two weeks.\nThe Neupro patch does seem to help a little. Sometimes when I forget to put it on, I sleep the same way as when I had stuck it on. Other times, I think I do sense that it is doing something.\nSo far, good. I‚Äôve had bad experience with dopamine agonists. Before I was clearly diagnosed with PD, I went to a doctor who prescribed Requip (rpiniriole), which caused me to nearly lose consciousness at work. A few months later, I was prescribed Mirapex (pramipexole) 2.5 mg/ tid and I almost fell asleep while driving. After some research, I read that studies have shown that 1 mg/tid provides the most therapeutic dose and that more doesn‚Äôt help. So I stayed on it for along time, then reduced it to 1mg at bedtime to function as sleep aid. Finally, since it wasn‚Äôt doing much to help my insomnia, I quit that and now don‚Äôt take any praimipexole.\n[Remember that you cannot generalize from one Parky to another, and that you should consult a neurologist\xa0 specializing in movement disorders / Parkinsonism before making any changes.]\n'], ['\nI have been on Neupro for several years.\xa0 My movement disorder neurologist started me at 1mg and ramped me up to 8mg which I have used for at least 4 or 5 years.\xa0 Also 7.5 tabs/day of Sinemet, 1mg Azilect (rasagiline) and Amantadine (2/day).\xa0 No side effects from the Neupro.\xa0 My understanding of Neupro‚Äôs advantage is a more even availability, over time,\xa0 in the body than oral agonists.\xa0 Only two downsides:\xa0 Even with Medicare Part D it is very very pricey.\xa0 Also, you need to develop a chart for placement or you get itchy dermatitis.\xa0 (e.g:\xa0 Monday ‚Äìleft arm, upper, front; tuesday left arm, lower , front‚Ä¶etc.)\xa0 or you can use the chart on the manufacturer‚Äôs website).\xa0 I have a seven day rotation schedule.\xa0 The mfg recommends 14 days.\xa0 My neurologist says in my case the arms work better than other locations.\xa0 8mg patches use\xa0 a lot of real-estate.\xa0 Remember:\xa0 ‚Äúone size fits all‚Äù doesn‚Äôt apply to us ‚ÄúParkies‚Äù.\n'], ['\nMy neurologist is anxious for me to try Neupro, because my chief complaint is that I am deeply affected, both physically and mentally, when I enter those terrible ‚Äúoff‚Äù\xa0 periods when my Rytary does not work as well as it should. Neupro, with its mechanism for continuous dose dispensing, should in theory help me avoid those ‚Äúoff‚Äù episodes. But , as others have already mentioned, most people on Neupro continue to take a form of levidopa, albeit at a smaller dose. I also wonder how well the patch will adhere to my skin once the humid weather of SW Florida makes its appearance.

To avoid the risk of the patch coming off, not likely in the shower unless not applied firmly,  I tape it on with strong waterproof tape or get one of those waterproof cover seal patches to put over it to keep it dry and on.\nYou are fortunate you are being advised patches and a reduction in levodopa i have gone other way doubled the levodopa/carbidopa 250/25 mg and now looking at 16 mg patches and doing an apomorphine test on the 21st of this month to assess to either increasing oral/patch meds or having a dopamine pump.

So for my own sanity and that of my wonderful fiancee, who is also my primary caregiver who still works 12 hrs a day 5 days a week and to relieve the concerns and frustration of brilliant MS Neurologist we all know we have to do something rather severe and soon.\nI have had no problems with the patches as long I place them on air dry, wrinkle free skin like outer edge of shoulder and top of thigh. I find it also helps if you shave those areas occasionally as the patches seem to stick better.  Also when you remove the patch rubbing some tea tree oil or eucalyptus oil on the place where the patch was removes any residual adhesive and helps avoid any irritation, reactions or itchiness that may occur during or after you remove the patch.  And don‚Äôt forget to rotate around 4 or 5 different places on your body every morning when you apply, repetitive placements on the same place for multiple days can cause some really nasty irritations.\nGood luck with the Neupro Patches and I really hope they do the trick for you.

June 2017 diagnosed with Parkinsons\n2. Consultant prescribed Rasagaline (with Madopar/Sinemet to follow later)\n3. 2017- April 2019 continued as per 2\n4. April 2019-June 2019 started Madopar 50/12.5Mg no benefit (consultant queried Parkinsons diagnosis) some side effects discontinued Madopar\n5. July 2019 CT scan all clear no abnormalities\n6. August 2019 anxiety becomes a problem commence meds (Pregabalin)\n7. December 2019 anxiety worse Pregabalin increased 100Mg x 3 times/day.\n8. December 2019 Dat scan requested ,anxiety much worse . Madopar 50/12.5Mg restarted. x 3 doses per day\n9. January 2020 Dat scan ,severe dopamine deficit Parkinsons confirmed. Madopar increased 100/25Mg x 4 doses per day\n10. February 2020 Madopar increased 150/37.5Mg x 4 doses/day\n11. March 2020 Anxiety very bad Pregabalin continues as per 7 no apparent improvement\nIt was around June last year that all of the family was with her (myself, wife and children) and she at that point was not too bad. We actually live in Spain so I/we dont see that much of her unfortunately. For some months now she hasn¬¥t really wanted visitors at all. My father lives with her in the UK.\nSince last June however she seems to have gone down hill quite quickly and as mentioned above in January this year her DAT Scan showed severe dopamine deficiency. She mainly had the DAT scan as the Madopar did not seem to be helping her much and follwing the DAT scan the dosage was increased. She is now on a dosage of 150/37.5Mg x 4 doses/day.\nShe is also suffering with quite bad anxiety for which she is taking Pregabalin.\nUnfortunately the Pregabalin does not seem to be decreasing her anxiety much and the Madopar only seems to work for an hour or so although she only has been taking the current dosage since February.\nThe thing that causes alot of anxiety and seems to stress her the most is the shaking which she has on both sides of her body. As I understand stress and anxiety can worsen the tremor so its a bit catch 22.\nIt seems that the anxiety is really affecting her at the moment perhaps as much as the PD with regards to her general state and quality of life.\nSo‚Ä¶.I am wondering if others have had a similar experience and if anyone can offer any advice.\nThanks in advance for any comments and I hope you are all managing to take care of yourselves and stay safe in the current situation that we all find ourselves.\n'], ['\nHello, Steve.\nI‚Äôm a person with PD.\xa0 I‚Äôm blessed to have my wife as my care partner.\xa0 My PD is in early stages yet, and my neurologist and my primary doctor have treated my wife as an important team member from the start.\xa0 Sometimes, it‚Äôs no more than a squeeze of my hand or an arm around the shoulder.\xa0 She hears my watch beeping before I do, and reminds me it‚Äôs time for my med‚Äôs.\xa0 She has been with me on every appointment, and we discuss every change or sign of progression.\xa0 So we‚Äôre on a good foundation for what the future brings.\nWith you in Spain and your mother in the UK, I really don‚Äôt know how to advise.\xa0 Your mother needs a care partner by her side, and I hope it‚Äôs not too late for someone to take on that role.\xa0 Is your father being a care partner for her?\nAnd it‚Äôs really the neurologist and the doctor together that need to advise on meds and dosage.\nPatience is key.\xa0 PD is something that will go on changing, as you‚Äôve already experienced, and change is liable to be hard for your mother.\nI don‚Äôt want to sound judgmental, but this is really from my heart.\xa0 We‚Äôre wishing you and your family all the best as you search for solutions,\nPhil\n'], ['\nHI Steve,\nit sounds as though your Mom is having a tough time.\xa0 \xa0I am sorry for her struggles.\xa0 You are a good son, trying to do the best for your Mom and I am sure she must\xa0 take comfort in that.\xa0 You didnt say how old she\xa0 is or what her mobility is like, but, I have found exercise to be the BEST thing for Parkinson‚Äôs and more and more doctors are stressing this.\xa0 Rock Steady Boxing is the best thing to ever happen to me and many others with PD.\xa0 I have seen people come in with a walker and extreme lack of mobility on their own, and after a few months of classes 2x/week, they were able to forego their walker.\xa0 \xa0The classes are for people with PD only and all levels of ability.\xa0 there are a few in UK, Glasgow, Widnes and Wirral.\xa0 here is a link:\xa0 https://rocksteadyboxing.org/find-a-class/#go_here\n\xa0\nDance for PD is also an excellent program and they have online classes that can be taken:\xa0 https://danceforparkinsons.org\nI don‚Äôt know anything about Madopar or Pregabalin so I cannot comment on them.\xa0 One thing for sure, PD manifests itself differently in everyone, both in terms of rate of progression and what therapies will work or not work.\nI am not a health professional so I can only speak from my experiences.\xa0 Bottom line, I believe movement and exercise are the best things to combat stress, anxiety, PD symptoms and PD progression.\xa0 \xa0I do take carbidopa/levodopa and selegeline so that I can exercise.\xa0 \xa0 I wish you luck and hope for the best for your Mom.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nSteve, I did a little research on Madopar.\xa0 Apparently that is a brand name for benserazide/levodopa.\xa0 \xa0It seems in Europe, benserazide is used while carbidopa is used in the USA with levodopa .\xa0 \xa0The function of both benserazide and carbidopa is the same; helps to prevent nausea caused by premature conversion of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain.\xa0 I have found with this disease, that one must be proactive (the caregiver and person with PD) and must educate themselves.\xa0 I have found a book, The New Parkinson‚Äôs Disease Treatment Book (2015 edition) by Dr. Eric Ahlskog to be a great reference book\n'], ['\nHi Steve,\nI‚Äôm sorry your mom is having such a rough time.\xa0 I was diagnosed in Jan. 2011, and the summer of 2013 was absolutely my worst time, so I hope my response will provide some encouragement.\xa0 I see that your mom is on anti-anxiety meds (so am I), but I don‚Äôt see an anti-depressant in your information.\xa0 I started taking the lowest dosage of Venlafaxine XR capsules during that summer of 2013, and that was the first step to getting my life back.\xa0 It does take something like six weeks to be effective, but for me it was totally worth it.\nThe next step, and on this I totally agree with Jean, was to get involved in exercise classes that my local hospital offers.\xa0 I started with T‚Äôai Chi, then added Beginner‚Äôs Yoga, and then added an exercise class.\xa0 These classes are for those of us over 65, and most of us in fact have some condition which may well call for a modification of some of the activities, which is considered fine.\xa0 I have been doing these three classes for years (Right now, of course, we are not having classes because of Covid-19, but some of the classes are starting to be reactivated with the help of Zoom so we can follow these online while we are at home.), and they have given me my life back!\xa0 I never would have expected, at 73, to be going to classes like these, but they are so much fun, I have met so many people who have become friends, and I have regained balance, flexibility, and stamina.\nI do also follow many PD support programs and groups online, and one thing I read recently was that there seems to be little correlation to the amount of tremor one has and to the quality of life, but that there is a huge correlation to loneliness and quality of life with PD.\xa0 I\xa0 certainly believe this is true.\xa0 Your mom may not be receptive to going to a class like this, but have your dad check out what is available and then gently suggest that she tries one.\xa0 Libraries as well as hospitals by me offer inexpensive programs like this, and though I have not been able to find one of the programs that are specifically for those with PD, for me that has not been a problem.\nI do deal with anxiety fairly often, so I always have my anti-anxiety meds with me, but I find that when I am out and having a good time with my friends I hardly ever need them at that time.\nI remember how I was in the summer of 2013, and that person did not believe that a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù kind of life would ever be possible again.\xa0 Since then, my husband and I have traveled around the US as well as taking some international trips.\xa0 For me life is good ‚Äì sometimes a bit challenging, but an adventure that I am happy to take.\xa0 I wish that for your mom!\n'], ['\nButyric acid supplements, have her try them. They worked for me in reversing my PD. Anxiety is also gone.\n'], ['\nHi Steve, I‚Äôve dealt with severe anxiety over the years, to the point calling 911 for EMS because it felt like a heart attack. \xa0At its worse was about 5 years ago, I was experiencing bad dyskinesia, with my neurologist we tried adjusting my meds by lowering the dosage to help with dyskinesia, which it did, but completely put me into extreme anxiety attacks, I was hyperventilating, trouble getting my breath and fast panting breathing.\n‚ÄúAnxiety is a common non-motor symptom of PD. It is important to note that anxiety is not simply a reaction to the diagnosis of Parkinson‚Äôs, but is instead a part of the disease itself, caused by changes in the brain chemistry of the brain‚Äù, from this article about PD and anxiety, https://www.parkinson.org/Understanding-Parkinsons/Symptoms/Non-Movement-Symptoms/Anxiety, so lowering my meds too much made the anxiety worse, my doctor put me on Lexapro antidepressant, which greatly helped.\nSo I‚Äôm wondering if possibly your mother needs to change the dose of her meds, ask the doctor about an antidepressant, or trying another type of med, like Rytary, which is a time release capsule. I haven‚Äôt had a panic attack since being put on Lexapro, it really helped me out. I know how bad it feels to be under the grip of anxiety, I feel for your mother, it‚Äôs like going out of your mind, but I think she can overcome this with the right PD med and antidepressant, she may have to try a few different options till she gets the help she needs. \xa0There is also the Neupro patch, which is a transdermal med applied once a day, working all day. \xa0I hope my experience helps in some way, but most important, don‚Äôt give up till she gets the help she nneed.\n'], ['\nHi, Steve.\n\xa0\nPlease allow me to add my 2 centavos. As others have mentioned, I think someone from your family has to work with your mother‚Äôs neurologist to find the best PD medicine and the correct dosage of this medicine. It is difficult for some of your compatriots in the US to translate their experiences to your mother‚Äôs location. One or more of your respondents have mentioned Rytary. For what it is worth, the drug has been a godsend for me.\xa0 It is a time-release version of carbidopa/levodopa and I find that it can last some time for 4-5 hours. There are a number of capsule strengths, and it took me some time to find the right dosage. As with many\xa0 PD meds, you and your Mom‚Äôs neurologist have to be flexible, willing to adjust the dosage. The major drawback of Rytary is its cost. I am fortunate. I have a great health plan, and I do not pay for Rytary at all. The ‚Äúlist‚Äù price that I see on my drug packages equates to an annual cost of $15,000.\nAs to her anxiety, some of the drugs being mentioned are quite potent, and I have not had too much success with most of them.\xa0 The SSRI‚Äôs (Zoloft, Lexipro, et.al.) were particularly harmful to me, driving me to think some terrible thoughts about my continued existence. Some people have had success with these drugs. I agree with others that adding physical exercise and mentally relaxing pursuits (tai chi, meditation) may be helpful. If it is decided to stop the strong psychotherapeutic drug, it must be done slowly.\nOne other thing. Have you ever looked at DBS (deep brain stimulation) as a treatment for her tremors? This technique is admittedly invasive and will make you cringe when you first hear the details of the technique. BUT, it works. There are neurosurgeons in the US who have become experts at using this procedure, and I imagine that the UK probably has them also. There is another treatment therapy that I would research if I were you. Go to sonimodul.ch . A researcher/doctor in Switzerland has been doing some amazing things with MRI guided ultrasound waves aimed at the most affected areas of the brain. This technique was invented in Israel, and the Swiss institute has been using it for some time. It‚Äôs called Exablate Neuro. My neurologist has urged me to wait a while before pursuing treatment because I do not suffer from tremors. The technique‚Äôs track record with non-tremor aspects of PD is not as developed.\n\xa0\nHope you are able to help your mother improve.\n\xa0\nRegards,\n\xa0\nSteve\n'], ['\nHello Mr. Steve\nPermission to share about my experience with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, I was diagnosed with Parkinson‚Äôs age of 20 years. During my time with Parkinson‚Äôs Disease, I also felt that some drugs made non-motor symptoms appear. Some non-motor symptoms are anxiety and depression. I do not really know whether this is indeed a reaction from chemicals in the brain due to Parkinson‚Äôs Disease or there are some drugs that can cause non-motor symptoms. For my non-motor symptoms that I convey to the neurologist, my neurologist said that it can indeed trigger anxiety, stress, and several other non-motor symptoms. Then, my neurologist gave me some medicines for non-motor symptoms, if in Indonesia I was given Setraline, and Resperidon. My non-motor symptoms, I also try to reduce it by walking on the porch, reading books, interacting with friends, humor and so on. For me personally the symptoms can be controlled because the treatment of Parkinson‚Äôs Disease requires comprehensive treatment.\nHopefully the current situation improves soon and all of you friends can move normally and as usual.

They have been and are trying various combinations of meds, some of which seem to make her feel worse it seems and she therefore is tempted to give up on them after a short while but as Phil mentioned above I think she needs to be more patient with some.\nWhen you mention ‚Äúit‚Äôs like going out of your mind‚Äù, that is certainly a feeling that I think she is suffering from.\nI see you again mention anti-depressants, so this looks like it is definitely worth investigating, as are your other suggestions.\nMy dad mentioned that a couple of weeks ago she seemed to go catatonic (wasn‚Äôt moving, just staring into space) for a long period of time one morning which the doctors put down to a severe panic attack so again looks to be similar to what you and others are describing.\nThanks again, and we won¬¥t give up üôÇ\n‚Äî‚Äî-\n@Steve ‚Äì Again, many thanks for your insights and advice. All of this is certainly going to give my father and I something to think about and explore.\nThe time release option sounds interesting (Rytary). It seems that the PD drug that my mother is currently on (Madopar) works for her for about 90 minutes and then she has a bad 2 hours or so until the next dose so that upsets her too as she knows she‚Äôs only going to feel better for a short period of time. I think she takes a slow-release version of the drug at night before she goes to bed but basically does not seem to get that much relief from the PD symptoms and has to take sleeping pills otherwise the shaking keeps her awake.\nRe the DBS and focused ultrasound, we are aware of those procedures and will probably look into them further as the Covid-19 situation improves. The shaking is a very big problem for my mother and one of the things which seems to cause a lot of her anxiety.\n‚Äî‚Äî-\n@Argya ‚Äì Thanks for sharing your experience. It seems that the balance of the correct drugs is the key as the fight is against both the PD and anxiety/depression and at the same time It does seem that my mum needs to try and persist with some form of exercise and more interaction with other people. Both my father and I do notice that she perks up when we have a skype conversation and gets to speak a little with her grandchildren here in Spain but she does not seem to really want to interact with others at the moment.\n‚Äî‚Äî-\nI want to thank you all once again for your kind input and advice.

I‚Äôm going to post it anyway, though, because of the surprising help he‚Äôs gotten with anxiety the past few months.\nUntil about a year ago, his symptoms tracked with the ebb and flow of his Rytary (and before that, Stalevo) dosages. In the past year, however, it has become much more complicated to track his symptoms; they are a mix of purely physical and largely psychological. He tenses up, gets obsessive about being taken for a car ride, starts shaking, and often spends the rest of the day severely ‚Äòoff‚Äô and unresponsive to subsequent Rytary doses. Passive relaxation aids (guiding his breathing, heavy blanket, heating pad, soft music, etc.) help (very) occasionally, but in general he does not have the awareness or concentration to use active relaxation methods.\nWe\xa0 readanecdotal accounts that many PD patients were responding well to TouchPoints, wristwatch-like gadgets that create alternating vibrations on each wrist in a relaxing rhythm. It was a one-time purchase, would not affect any pharmacological balances, and seemed to address the psychological arousal we thought we were seeing, so we bought and tried them.\nThey‚Äôve been shockingly effective. If the caregiver recognizes the early stages of anxiety and puts them on his wrists, he avoids the ‚Äòoff‚Äô periods ~85% of the time. Occasionally, maybe a third of the time, they‚Äôll even pull him out of a crash (our term for his severe off periods) that is already underway.\nI wouldn‚Äôt bother posting, given how different the context of his symptoms is from your Mom‚Äôs, but anxiety being front and center of your post makes me think it is worth sharing. If you want to look into it, searching ‚ÄúTouchpoints for Parkinson‚Äôs‚Äù ought to work.\n\xa0\nJoel\n'], ['\nHi Joel,\nThanks for sharing yours and your uncle‚Äôs experience. I have taken a look at the TouchPoints and it does look interesting.

But it seems like the progression of the disease makes finding the right dosage difficult. And since it‚Äôs an ever-changing process, our needs seem to shift with time.\nWhat is it that makes treating PD symptoms so complicated? Do you ever feel like you‚Äôve found a good balance? And does it get easier to regulate medications as you become more attuned to the disease?\n'], ['\nJust an interesting question. I think you can answer this by your self.\n'], ['\nHi Mary Beth, Hope your Dad is doing well.\nI chose to take medication right after my formal diagnosis.  It was obvious that I had had Parkinson‚Äôs long before.  My neurologist also thought it was in my best interest to start right away and I am glad I did.  I had almost immediate relief.  Although my medication has changed a few times last year I think I have the right mix at present. But only for present not for future. I think regulating is tricky is because things keep changing;  symptoms, on and off times, progression etc. Parkinson‚Äôs itself is very tricky and it follows that regulating medications would also be an issue. I think it is a given that my medications will keep changing.\n'], ['\nHere are some thoughts on why regulating\xa0 Parkinson‚Äôs medications can be tricky:\n1. Parkinson‚Äôs is a progressive disease, so over time medications will have to be increased. But the most effective increase is not obvious, Do\xa0 you increase dopamine (Cd/Ld), add a dopamine agonist to make the Cd/Ld work better, or add an MAO-B\xa0 like rasagiline to slow the breakdown of\xa0 dopamine?\n2. It‚Äôs easy to forget that\xa0 you must wait at least an hour after eating before you take your Cd/Ld. Preferred is to take your first dose when\xa0 you get up, so you‚Äôll\xa0 have an empty stomach, then wait an hour before breakfast. But then there are lunch and dinner. I‚Äôm taking 5 doses a day, at 6, 10, 2, 6, and 10. Do you see the problem? The 2 pm and 6 pm are regularly taken too close to meal time, and a protein slug at lunch or dinner pretty much knocks to Cd/Ld.\n3. If your bowels are plugged with junk (that is, if you are constipated), the absorption of the Cd/Ld in the intestine inhibited.\n4. In some Parkies, exercise can burn off dopamine, putting the Parky into an off period.\nIn other words, titrating\xa0 your meds is\xa0 shooting at a moving target.\nLastly, half the time I get a refill, the pills (always generic) are made by any one of several different manufacturers, mostly in India. Since the FDA allows a rather wide range of potency in\xa0 a drug as long as it has ‚Äúbioequivalency,‚Äù you might be getting a slightly different potency with every refill.\n\xa0\n'], ['\nGood question Mary Beth\nHello to Robert Harris from another member of the ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù clan.\xa0\xa0 My son is the sixth Robert in our family tree (we do change the middle names, so no Roman Numerals after our names.).\nWe seem to share a lot on this PD journey.\xa0 I too take pills 5 or six times a day and seem to have been issued the same ‚Äúplumbing‚Äù system that you describe.\xa0 And I too show evidence that PD bowel problems can interfere with Sinemet absorption.\nOne difference so far is that my doctors have an overall theme that PD is a dopamine deficiency disease.\xa0 PD people need more dopamine.\xa0 That‚Äôs the only med I take directly for the PD.\xa0 2 regular pills 5 times a day plus some overriding extended release pills on top of the regular doses and 2 extended release at bedtime.\xa0 They have told me that the other Parkinson‚Äôs pills have too many side effects and after tying them over the years, they avoid them.\xa0 I do take a medication for low blood pressure which is a feature of my PD.\xa0 I am in my 15th months of taking any meds.

After the second surgery, there were no headaches, so we aren‚Äôt really sure what was different. It was a three step process. (1) Hole in skull ‚Äì\xa0 inserted the wires into his brain (used image-guided approach because his head was too big for the halo method). (2) Two weeks later they ran the wires down the back of his neck (under the skin, but you can still feel the hump of the wires) and into the front of his upper chest to attach to the transmitter that is implanted in the chest cavity. (3) After incision heals a bit, go see neurologist to turn on the transmitter. His hands stopped trembling IMMEDIATELY. I was in tears.\nHis hands don‚Äôt tremble at all now. And if there‚Äôs a little break-through trembling occasionally we can go up a notch (at home, with our remote) to control this. A useful tool as we face constant progression of the disease to keep him independent as long as possible. We see the neurologist twice a year for transmitter check-ups. He‚Äôs going great for a 77 year old. Mobility is another challenge, and speech and swallowing are intermittent obstacles, but we deal with it. They are not helped by DBS. But he can hold a cup of coffee, surf the Internet, brush his teeth, use an IPad, write his name, feed himself, dress himself, etc. Without DBS all of that would be out of reach, literally and figuratively.\nTips ‚Äì battery transmitters last a couple of years and then have to be replaced in the chest. Outpatient surgery. Depends on how high your settings are as to how long they last. After one replacement cycle the next time we opted for rechargeable transmitters and have to hook him up like a cell phone couple times a week for an hour or two. Not convenient, but a world of difference from the trembling that would exist without it.\nGood luck with your journey!\n'], ['Posts']]"

I really fell off the Parkinson‚Äôs cliff in those three months). \xa0But I knew that the MSA just did not make sense to me.) 3rd diagnosis in October 2018.\xa0 Slow and Stiff Parkinsonism and HY State II 1/2.\xa0 (This diagnosis made sense to me)\xa0 Started on Sinemet.\xa0\xa0 Obviously, I signed up with the 3rd opinion folks.\nI also have low blood pressure problems and bladder problems.\nFrom November 2018 through October 2019 we upped the Sinemet and lowered the Sinemet and upped the Sinemet and added low blood pressure medications and bladder/prostate meds.\nBlood pressure.\xa0 First Florinef and now Midodrine.\xa0 Florinef works by messing with your water storage and such and blood volume.\xa0\xa0 Midodrine works by making your vessels squeeze when you stand up.\xa0 I felt like I was drowning with Florinef.\xa0 The switch to Midodrine worked just as well for me in raising my standing blood pressure just as much as the Florinef without the drowning feelings.\xa0 So that is what I am taking now.\nBladder problems.\xa0 I was having male bladder problems which is apparently very common in Parkinsonism.\xa0 It was presumed that I was having prostate problems since I am a 66 years old guy.\xa0 So I was given two prostate/bladder pills.\xa0 Both of which lower blood pressure!!\xa0 And I was referred to a Neuro -Urologist who did some very interesting bladder tests that I am sure the rest of the world don‚Äôt even know exist!\xa0 Result was that there was a significant obstruction causing retention etc etc.\xa0 Most often such results to those tests are caused by prostate problems.\xa0 Prostate surgery was scheduled!\xa0\xa0 On the day of surgery, the Neuro-Urologist, at the pre surgery conference, said he wanted us to be prepared to not having the surgery because he now was feeling that this could be a neurological issue and not a prostate issue.\xa0 He said this was just a professional judgment he was considering after carefully reviewing my file, other PD exam files, and the earlier tests.\xa0 He instincts were correct.\xa0 At pre-op testing, I had a very interesting ultrasound procedure and very interesting cystoscope procedure which showed the prostate and bladder parts of my plumbing was not only normal but actually better than normal for my age.\xa0 So no surgery and, by the way, you didn‚Äôt and don‚Äôt need any prostate or bladder pills.\xa0 The problem was sorta like the general Parkinsonism thing as regards to walking and moving etc.\xa0 (I never really had much of any tremor, by the way).\xa0 The exit valve of my bladder emptying system is not communicating well with my brain.\xa0 So all those bladder and prostate pills that lower blood pressure were stopped.\nBy the way.\xa0 In case you haven‚Äôt figured it out by now.\xa0 When I say I had a very interesting test, I am giving you a hint that it the type of test that when they tell you what they are going to do and after they have done it, all you can say is ‚ÄúOh my goodness!‚Äù\nThat brings me to where I am now on my medications.\nMy Doctor‚Äôs consistent theme is to treat the problems.\nFor the stiff and slow Parkinsonism.\xa0 Up the carbidopa/levodopa until it works.\xa0 I now take enough Sinemet and Sinemet Cr to get 24 hour coverage.\xa0 10 to 12 25/100 Sinemet pills\xa0 plus 4 50/200 Sinemet CR pills per day.\nFor the low blood pressure.\xa0 Midrodine three times a day through mid afternoon.\nTo fight apathy and lethargy.\xa0 I now take Cymbalta twice a day.\nFor the bladder a very interesting solution.\xa0 I now am familiar with self-catheterization!\nIf I am late with a Sinemet dose, I really really know it.\xa0 As others have said, I cannot have food in my stomach for the Sinemet to work for me.\xa0 That means no food 2 hours before and 1 hour after taking the pills.\nSo that is the story.\xa0 Flood the guy with Sinemet and just get on with things.\xa0 It apparently is working now.\nLet‚Äôs see how long this works.\nThanks and best wished to you all.\nRobert C.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['Posts']]"

A general rule of thumb is to start medication when the Parkinson‚Äôs symptoms become restricting or disruptive in some way.

I know medications are inevitable, but the side effects scare me more than the symptoms I have now.  Thx for your comments\n'], ['\nDear Ann Marie,\nThis is Mike Scott. Sorry I haven‚Äôt responded to your questions sooner. In my opinion, your body will tell you when you need to begin your medications‚Ä¶ Most of my biking took place at around 8,000-9,500 ft in the Wasatch Mountains close to the Alta Ski Resort, which is very similar to your altitudes around Leadville in the Rockies‚Ä¶ At those altitudes, you know well how much your body is tested‚Ä¶. Your move to the mtns in Arizona where you will be riding at lower altitudes should give you more time in my opinion‚Ä¶ I actually had a few falls when my tremors got to the point where I could not stay on trail during an outbreak. Also, my ability to do fine motor skills completely stopped\xa0 during my outbreaks. The only thing that the Carbo/Lebo stopped where the tremors. I did not notice any change in my cardio output or muscle strength. Sometimes when we are training at a high level we\xa0 can tend to get a little ‚Äúbullheaded‚Äù about needing the medication‚Ä¶ For me it only took a couple falls in really bad places to pound it into my head that unless I began the medications I was going to end up with a traumatic injury that would end my biking days or at worst, kill me!‚Ä¶ üôÅ\nRelative to Arizona, I have found that my ability\xa0 to ride hard in high temperatures has dropped considerably, so you would do well to plan your Summer rides in the early morning. The only hazards I have found to early morning rides is that the deer, elk and moose are also more active in the morning. Nothing like coming nose to nose with a 300 lb moose when you are going fast downhill. You‚Äôd be surprised at how many more pretty sites you see when you are going slower plus colliding with a moose can have very negative effects on your body and your future!‚Ä¶.. üôÅ\nI hope I have covered your questions. Feel free to ask if you have more for me. You might find it interesting to know that the 10th Mountain Division began in those mountains around Leadville in WW-ll. While they were expected to be effective in the Scandinavia, their greatest Claim to Fame was the (what was thought to be impossible) climb of the shear face of Mt Belvederer in Central Italy. The Germans had put huge cannons on the top and that had stopped the Northern Push of the Allied Forces in Italy‚Ä¶ They made that climb in two nights, (bivouacking in the daylight on a small shelf about half way up) and assaulted and captured that garrison in the early morning when most of the Germans were still in bed! I believe that is still harolleded as on of the greatest climbing assaults in Military History!\nMike Scott\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nHi Ann Marie,\nAlthough I like to theorize that lifelong commitment to exercise may delay disease onset, in my case until my early 60s, it may be more of a hunch than reality. But, since exercise is beneficial (read: vital) for PD it makes sense. If you have to deal with PD at least developing it later in life is much better than earlier onset. All I know is maintaining an active lifestyle has, and continues, to pay dividends in so many ways‚Äìmostly helping me to feel good, fit and healthy (despite having PD!). I feel about as energetic as I ever have. My neuro told me a couple of years ago that carbidopa-levodopa does not improve balance issues, but exercise certainly does. That‚Äôs reason enough to maintain a regular exercise regime and it‚Äôs probably more important now than ever. I feel blessed to be able to continue riding, that‚Äôs for sure.\nWhether vigorous exercise can replace Sinemet to minimize motor symptoms is unknown to me. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs possible but it would be on an individual level and the severity of symptoms, as well as one‚Äôs ability to tolerate symptoms. For me, symptoms started about 8 years ago with left foot tremors. The tremors stopped when in bed and were more of an annoyance than a real problem so I didn‚Äôt seek medical help, thinking I had an essential tremor or something.\nThat changed 3 years ago when tremors spread to lower left arm and hand and did NOT subside at night. It became a 24/7 reality. As any of us can attest, it‚Äôs very difficult to sleep while part of the anatomy is moving. It became apparent to me, and in a hurry, that I needed medical attention. Sinemet was subsequently prescribed and I was immensely grateful as it provided much-needed tremor relief. Uninterrupted sleep was possible again, and I have not been bothered by tremors since.\nHowever, in late February I changed from Sinemet to Rytary\xa0 ER (3-36.25 mg-145 mg 3 times a day dosed 5 hours apart). The dosage was based on the equivalent amount of Sinemet that I was taking, but due to Rytary‚Äôs granule formulation (consisting of both instant and extended-release levodopa) about two-thirds of the levodopa is lost in the bowels and does not get absorbed, so although Rytary‚Äôs dose looked higher than Sinemet‚Äôs, with the conversion it is about the same. In short, dosing modifications are common during this transition to get it right as it‚Äôs not an exact science.\nHowever, after a week of 3 Rytary caps per dose, I decided to try taking only 2 caps per dose instead. The lower amount still provided an effective dose and I‚Äôve noticed only a slight increase in stiffness but no increased slowness, although slowness was not previously present. I‚Äôm a big fan of using the lowest effective medication dosing.\nMy new theory is by taking less levodopa now may provide some wiggle room when (if) levodopa-induced dyskinesia happens later on. It‚Äôs my understanding that levodopa dosing is usually increased with the onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, so if that happens I may not need as much levodopa increase in the future. I might add that I also added an oral CBD emulsion almost 2 years ago that has helped with other symptoms (primarily swallowing difficulties) and it may be helpful with motor symptoms resulting in the need for less levodopa, but that‚Äôs another story.\nHope this helps. You‚Äôll know when to start carbidopa-levodopa, but in the meantime keep on riding‚Äìmay there be more Parkinson folks on spokes! Btw, with many thanks to the Davis Phinney Foundation for PD, I discovered Patient Assistance Programs that help people in need to afford their meds, and Rytary is very expensive.

I tried several HIIT cycling classes at the YMCA. I loved the company, our sometimes black comedy like the time one of the cyclists was headed to the floor and the instructor made an incredible save, cradling his head. The rest of us erupted into clapping, hi-fives, whistles and catcalls, mystifying other gym rats.\nBut, the agony of those itty bitty bicycle seats, and the effect of the hunched form on the lower back made me give it up. Instead I gravitated to the gentle yoga classes, TaiChi, and Feldenkrais, popular in Europe and the U.K. They describe it as Awareness through Movement, where a skilled practitioner  guides you through a very individualized program of finding a different set of muscles and neurons  to circumvent the effects of loss caused by Parkinson‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a very adaptable approach to the myriad of seemingly random body part failures.\nAn example: I have severe osteoarthritis of the knee, so painful I have to limit any walking. My instructor worked with me on transferring weight side to side, using areas of the foot and ankle to grip the floor, then establish a rolling effect of the feet front to back, walking, but using a different neural pathway. From there she steered me through opening the pelvis, letting it take on more structural support. The effect of these conscious movements shifts pressure away from the knee, so walking is less painful. She also noticed I pair arm and leg on the same side when I walk,  rather than diagonal right leg/left arm and left leg/ right arm. Changing to the diagonals improves balance and stability. Though It‚Äôs hard to change something as basic as walking this approach is helpful.\nOvercoming fatigue is a huge problem. But since I like exercise class more than stuff I should be doing like paying bills, laundry, housework, etc., I play hooky by going to class. My regimen is very non threatening, much of it done seated or on the floor, so I don‚Äôt dread the experience.

When I told my PTs, they always said that it couldn‚Äôt be: Everyone knows that exercise releases endorphins and dopamine,which makes you feel great, even though you might be tired. That is the physiological model they are tied to, which they learn in all their training.\nIn my opinion,\xa0 the model is accurate for normal people. \xa0When normal people exercise, more dopamine is created and the signaling continues. But Parkies can‚Äôt make any more dopamine to match the increased need, so what little they have is oxidized, leaving\xa0 the exerciser with a feeling of exhaustion and weakness. Parfkies who feel exhausted all the time might need a dosage adjustment. If I feel off before I exercise, I take a booster of 12.5/50 (half a 25/100 IR pill) 20 or 30 minutes before. (Caution: Always consult your neurologist before changing dosage or timing.)\nMore powerful than the pill as a booster is a new powdered form of levodopa that is inhaled.

I recently completed the PWR!Moves class instructor certification program. There were several Rock Steady Parkinson‚Äôs Boxing instructors also taking the PWR!Moves instructor certification training. They said they were there because they had witnessed how much better\xa0people who were doing the PWR!Moves program performed in boxing class and they realized boxing wasn‚Äôt providing everything their participants needed!\nPD is the only progressive neurological brain disease in which the rate of progression can be affected by doing the\xa0right kinds of targeted functional exercise. The research and evidenced-based PWR!Moves program was developed specifically to target both the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. PWR stands for\xa0Parkinson\xa0Wellness\xa0Recovery. It targets all of the functional movements we all need to do every day. Since we function in many different positions, we need to move and exercise in all of them as well. Just exercising in standing or sitting doesn‚Äôt help people with PD function better lying on their back, stomach or on all 4‚Äôs.\nThe PWR!Moves is a home-based daily program that is performed without any equipment and can be done anywhere there is room for an exercise mat on the floor. It can be adapted for anyone and at any stage of PD. PWR!Moves can be a standalone program or it can be integrated into any other form of exercise. It can be done while traveling, at work or on those cold snowy days when the roads are closed and you can‚Äôt get to the gym or exercise classes are canceled!\nResearch shows that it‚Äôs not just\xa0what\xa0we do, it‚Äôs\xa0how\xa0we do it that gives the best results. Parkinson‚Äôs disease causes stiffness (rigidity) in the body and tells people to move slower and smaller (bradykinesia). The key to the PWR!Moves is that it is an amplitude-based (moving BIG with high EFFORT) functional program that helps people to break through the stiffness and slow movement to move bigger and stronger!\nThe PWR!Moves also improves posture, balance, strength, agility and non-motor symptoms like sleep, fatigue, constipation and mood. It enhances and improves all aspects of everyday function including work, sports and hobbies. PWR!Moves reduce freezing and fall risk. Research shows the sooner after diagnosis people begin doing the PWR!Moves, the better they will do throughout life!\nIt‚Äôs so important to begin moving in the right ways as soon as possible to target the specific changes that come with a PD diagnosis. Please keep doing whatever exercise you love to do, BUT\xa0 please do PD-specific functional targeted amplitude training like PWR!Moves every day! Targeted amplitude-based exercise IS medicine for PD!\nFor more information on the research, the PWR!Moves, Dr. Becky Farley‚Äôs PWR!Gym or to find a certified PWR!Moves Therapist or Instructor in your area visit: pwr4life.org\nKeep Calm and PWR! on!\n'], ['Posts']]"

In my case, I was diagnosed with PD \xa013 months ago at age 73. \xa0My neurologist, who is in a PD Center of Excellence, recommended I start medication (Sinemet) right away, even though my motor control symptoms were slight ‚Äì a minor tremor in one hand. His reasoning was that I would ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù on a medication regimen. I actually felt ‚Äúok‚Äù at the time ‚Äì other than learning I had PD. So I decided, with all due respect, not to follow the doctor‚Äôs advice, due to my concerns about known medication side effects. I‚Äôve had two follow-up visits since then. He continues to recommend medication, but he respects that it‚Äôs my decision not to take anything until I feel like it will help. \xa0I continue to avoid medication. I follow my excercise regimen and continue to have no motor control issues other than a slightly more frequent hand tremor. \xa0More importantly, I feel fine (for 74).\nEffectiveness of excercise against PD is definitely correlated with the ‚Äúintensity level‚Äù as measured by heart rate. One reported Phase II clinical trial with treadmill exercise found that the group running 4 times a week at 80-85% of maximum \xa0heart rate had a significant improvement in motor scores compared to the group running at 60-65%.

Sorry I haven‚Äôt responded to your questions sooner. In my opinion, your body will tell you when you need to begin your medications‚Ä¶ Most of my biking took place at around 8,000-9,500 ft in the Wasatch Mountains close to the Alta Ski Resort, which is very similar to your altitudes around Leadville in the Rockies‚Ä¶ At those altitudes, you know well how much your body is tested‚Ä¶. Your move to the mtns in Arizona where you will be riding at lower altitudes should give you more time in my opinion‚Ä¶ I actually had a few falls when my tremors got to the point where I could not stay on trail during an outbreak. Also, my ability to do fine motor skills completely stopped\xa0 during my outbreaks. The only thing that the Carbo/Lebo stopped where the tremors. I did not notice any change in my cardio output or muscle strength. Sometimes when we are training at a high level we\xa0 can tend to get a little ‚Äúbullheaded‚Äù about needing the medication‚Ä¶ For me it only took a couple falls in really bad places to pound it into my head that unless I began the medications I was going to end up with a traumatic injury that would end my biking days or at worst, kill me!‚Ä¶ üôÅ\nRelative to Arizona, I have found that my ability\xa0 to ride hard in high temperatures has dropped considerably, so you would do well to plan your Summer rides in the early morning. The only hazards I have found to early morning rides is that the deer, elk and moose are also more active in the morning. Nothing like coming nose to nose with a 300 lb moose when you are going fast downhill. You‚Äôd be surprised at how many more pretty sites you see when you are going slower plus colliding with a moose can have very negative effects on your body and your future!‚Ä¶.. üôÅ\nI hope I have covered your questions. Feel free to ask if you have more for me. You might find it interesting to know that the 10th Mountain Division began in those mountains around Leadville in WW-ll. While they were expected to be effective in the Scandinavia, their greatest Claim to Fame was the (what was thought to be impossible) climb of the shear face of Mt Belvederer in Central Italy. The Germans had put huge cannons on the top and that had stopped the Northern Push of the Allied Forces in Italy‚Ä¶ They made that climb in two nights, (bivouacking in the daylight on a small shelf about half way up) and assaulted and captured that garrison in the early morning when most of the Germans were still in bed! I believe that is still harolleded as on of the greatest climbing assaults in Military History!\nMike Scott\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nHi Ann Marie,\nAlthough I like to theorize that lifelong commitment to exercise may delay disease onset, in my case until my early 60s, it may be more of a hunch than reality. But, since exercise is beneficial (read: vital) for PD it makes sense. If you have to deal with PD at least developing it later in life is much better than earlier onset. All I know is maintaining an active lifestyle has, and continues, to pay dividends in so many ways‚Äìmostly helping me to feel good, fit and healthy (despite having PD!). I feel about as energetic as I ever have. My neuro told me a couple of years ago that carbidopa-levodopa does not improve balance issues, but exercise certainly does. That‚Äôs reason enough to maintain a regular exercise regime and it‚Äôs probably more important now than ever. I feel blessed to be able to continue riding, that‚Äôs for sure.\nWhether vigorous exercise can replace Sinemet to minimize motor symptoms is unknown to me. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs possible but it would be on an individual level and the severity of symptoms, as well as one‚Äôs ability to tolerate symptoms. For me, symptoms started about 8 years ago with left foot tremors. The tremors stopped when in bed and were more of an annoyance than a real problem so I didn‚Äôt seek medical help, thinking I had an essential tremor or something.\nThat changed 3 years ago when tremors spread to lower left arm and hand and did NOT subside at night. It became a 24/7 reality. As any of us can attest, it‚Äôs very difficult to sleep while part of the anatomy is moving. It became apparent to me, and in a hurry, that I needed medical attention. Sinemet was subsequently prescribed and I was immensely grateful as it provided much-needed tremor relief. Uninterrupted sleep was possible again, and I have not been bothered by tremors since.\nHowever, in late February I changed from Sinemet to Rytary\xa0 ER (3-36.25 mg-145 mg 3 times a day dosed 5 hours apart). The dosage was based on the equivalent amount of Sinemet that I was taking, but due to Rytary‚Äôs granule formulation (consisting of both instant and extended-release levodopa) about two-thirds of the levodopa is lost in the bowels and does not get absorbed, so although Rytary‚Äôs dose looked higher than Sinemet‚Äôs, with the conversion it is about the same. In short, dosing modifications are common during this transition to get it right as it‚Äôs not an exact science.\nHowever, after a week of 3 Rytary caps per dose, I decided to try taking only 2 caps per dose instead. The lower amount still provided an effective dose and I‚Äôve noticed only a slight increase in stiffness but no increased slowness, although slowness was not previously present. I‚Äôm a big fan of using the lowest effective medication dosing.\nMy new theory is by taking less levodopa now may provide some wiggle room when (if) levodopa-induced dyskinesia happens later on. It‚Äôs my understanding that levodopa dosing is usually increased with the onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, so if that happens I may not need as much levodopa increase in the future. I might add that I also added an oral CBD emulsion almost 2 years ago that has helped with other symptoms (primarily swallowing difficulties) and it may be helpful with motor symptoms resulting in the need for less levodopa, but that‚Äôs another story.\nHope this helps. You‚Äôll know when to start carbidopa-levodopa, but in the meantime keep on riding‚Äìmay there be more Parkinson folks on spokes! Btw, with many thanks to the Davis Phinney Foundation for PD, I discovered Patient Assistance Programs that help people in need to afford their meds, and Rytary is very expensive.

I tried several HIIT cycling classes at the YMCA. I loved the company, our sometimes black comedy like the time one of the cyclists was headed to the floor and the instructor made an incredible save, cradling his head. The rest of us erupted into clapping, hi-fives, whistles and catcalls, mystifying other gym rats.\nBut, the agony of those itty bitty bicycle seats, and the effect of the hunched form on the lower back made me give it up. Instead I gravitated to the gentle yoga classes, TaiChi, and Feldenkrais, popular in Europe and the U.K. They describe it as Awareness through Movement, where a skilled practitioner  guides you through a very individualized program of finding a different set of muscles and neurons  to circumvent the effects of loss caused by Parkinson‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a very adaptable approach to the myriad of seemingly random body part failures.\nAn example: I have severe osteoarthritis of the knee, so painful I have to limit any walking. My instructor worked with me on transferring weight side to side, using areas of the foot and ankle to grip the floor, then establish a rolling effect of the feet front to back, walking, but using a different neural pathway. From there she steered me through opening the pelvis, letting it take on more structural support. The effect of these conscious movements shifts pressure away from the knee, so walking is less painful. She also noticed I pair arm and leg on the same side when I walk,  rather than diagonal right leg/left arm and left leg/ right arm. Changing to the diagonals improves balance and stability. Though It‚Äôs hard to change something as basic as walking this approach is helpful.\nOvercoming fatigue is a huge problem. But since I like exercise class more than stuff I should be doing like paying bills, laundry, housework, etc., I play hooky by going to class.

When I told my PTs, they always said that it couldn‚Äôt be: Everyone knows that exercise releases endorphins and dopamine,which makes you feel great, even though you might be tired. That is the physiological model they are tied to, which they learn in all their training.\nIn my opinion,\xa0 the model is accurate for normal people. \xa0When normal people exercise, more dopamine is created and the signaling continues. But Parkies can‚Äôt make any more dopamine to match the increased need, so what little they have is oxidized, leaving\xa0 the exerciser with a feeling of exhaustion and weakness. Parfkies who feel exhausted all the time might need a dosage adjustment. If I feel off before I exercise, I take a booster of 12.5/50 (half a 25/100 IR pill) 20 or 30 minutes before.

They said they were there because they had witnessed how much better\xa0people who were doing the PWR!Moves program performed in boxing class and they realized boxing wasn‚Äôt providing everything their participants needed!\nPD is the only progressive neurological brain disease in which the rate of progression can be affected by doing the\xa0right kinds of targeted functional exercise. The research and evidenced-based PWR!Moves program was developed specifically to target both the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. PWR stands for\xa0Parkinson\xa0Wellness\xa0Recovery. It targets all of the functional movements we all need to do every day. Since we function in many different positions, we need to move and exercise in all of them as well. Just exercising in standing or sitting doesn‚Äôt help people with PD function better lying on their back, stomach or on all 4‚Äôs.\nThe PWR!Moves is a home-based daily program that is performed without any equipment and can be done anywhere there is room for an exercise mat on the floor. It can be adapted for anyone and at any stage of PD. PWR!Moves can be a standalone program or it can be integrated into any other form of exercise. It can be done while traveling, at work or on those cold snowy days when the roads are closed and you can‚Äôt get to the gym or exercise classes are canceled!\nResearch shows that it‚Äôs not just\xa0what\xa0we do, it‚Äôs\xa0how\xa0we do it that gives the best results. Parkinson‚Äôs disease causes stiffness (rigidity) in the body and tells people to move slower and smaller (bradykinesia). The key to the PWR!Moves is that it is an amplitude-based (moving BIG with high EFFORT) functional program that helps people to break through the stiffness and slow movement to move bigger and stronger!\nThe PWR!Moves also improves posture, balance, strength, agility and non-motor symptoms like sleep, fatigue, constipation and mood. It enhances and improves all aspects of everyday function including work, sports and hobbies. PWR!Moves reduce freezing and fall risk. Research shows the sooner after diagnosis people begin doing the PWR!Moves, the better they will do throughout life!\nIt‚Äôs so important to begin moving in the right ways as soon as possible to target the specific changes that come with a PD diagnosis. Please keep doing whatever exercise you love to do, BUT\xa0 please do PD-specific functional targeted amplitude training like PWR!Moves every day! Targeted amplitude-based exercise IS medicine for PD!\nFor more information on the research, the PWR!Moves, Dr. Becky Farley‚Äôs PWR!Gym or to find a certified PWR!Moves Therapist or Instructor in your area visit: pwr4life.org\nKeep Calm and PWR! on!\n'], ['Posts']]"

His reasoning was that I would ‚Äúfeel better‚Äù on a medication regimen. I actually felt ‚Äúok‚Äù at the time ‚Äì other than learning I had PD. So I decided, with all due respect, not to follow the doctor‚Äôs advice, due to my concerns about known medication side effects. I‚Äôve had two follow-up visits since then.

I follow my excercise regimen and continue to have no motor control issues other than a slightly more frequent hand tremor. \xa0More importantly, I feel fine (for 74).\nEffectiveness of excercise against PD is definitely correlated with the ‚Äúintensity level‚Äù as measured by heart rate. One reported Phase II clinical trial with treadmill exercise found that the group running 4 times a week at 80-85% of maximum \xa0heart rate had a significant improvement in motor scores compared to the group running at 60-65%.

Sorry I haven‚Äôt responded to your questions sooner. In my opinion, your body will tell you when you need to begin your medications‚Ä¶ Most of my biking took place at around 8,000-9,500 ft in the Wasatch Mountains close to the Alta Ski Resort, which is very similar to your altitudes around Leadville in the Rockies‚Ä¶ At those altitudes, you know well how much your body is tested‚Ä¶. Your move to the mtns in Arizona where you will be riding at lower altitudes should give you more time in my opinion‚Ä¶ I actually had a few falls when my tremors got to the point where I could not stay on trail during an outbreak. Also, my ability to do fine motor skills completely stopped\xa0 during my outbreaks. The only thing that the Carbo/Lebo stopped where the tremors. I did not notice any change in my cardio output or muscle strength. Sometimes when we are training at a high level we\xa0 can tend to get a little ‚Äúbullheaded‚Äù about needing the medication‚Ä¶ For me it only took a couple falls in really bad places to pound it into my head that unless I began the medications I was going to end up with a traumatic injury that would end my biking days or at worst, kill me!‚Ä¶ üôÅ\nRelative to Arizona, I have found that my ability\xa0 to ride hard in high temperatures has dropped considerably, so you would do well to plan your Summer rides in the early morning. The only hazards I have found to early morning rides is that the deer, elk and moose are also more active in the morning. Nothing like coming nose to nose with a 300 lb moose when you are going fast downhill. You‚Äôd be surprised at how many more pretty sites you see when you are going slower plus colliding with a moose can have very negative effects on your body and your future!‚Ä¶.. üôÅ\nI hope I have covered your questions.

The Germans had put huge cannons on the top and that had stopped the Northern Push of the Allied Forces in Italy‚Ä¶ They made that climb in two nights, (bivouacking in the daylight on a small shelf about half way up) and assaulted and captured that garrison in the early morning when most of the Germans were still in bed! I believe that is still harolleded as on of the greatest climbing assaults in Military History!\nMike Scott\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nHi Ann Marie,\nAlthough I like to theorize that lifelong commitment to exercise may delay disease onset, in my case until my early 60s, it may be more of a hunch than reality. But, since exercise is beneficial (read: vital) for PD it makes sense. If you have to deal with PD at least developing it later in life is much better than earlier onset. All I know is maintaining an active lifestyle has, and continues, to pay dividends in so many ways‚Äìmostly helping me to feel good, fit and healthy (despite having PD!). I feel about as energetic as I ever have. My neuro told me a couple of years ago that carbidopa-levodopa does not improve balance issues, but exercise certainly does. That‚Äôs reason enough to maintain a regular exercise regime and it‚Äôs probably more important now than ever. I feel blessed to be able to continue riding, that‚Äôs for sure.\nWhether vigorous exercise can replace Sinemet to minimize motor symptoms is unknown to me. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs possible but it would be on an individual level and the severity of symptoms, as well as one‚Äôs ability to tolerate symptoms. For me, symptoms started about 8 years ago with left foot tremors. The tremors stopped when in bed and were more of an annoyance than a real problem so I didn‚Äôt seek medical help, thinking I had an essential tremor or something.\nThat changed 3 years ago when tremors spread to lower left arm and hand and did NOT subside at night. It became a 24/7 reality. As any of us can attest, it‚Äôs very difficult to sleep while part of the anatomy is moving. It became apparent to me, and in a hurry, that I needed medical attention. Sinemet was subsequently prescribed and I was immensely grateful as it provided much-needed tremor relief. Uninterrupted sleep was possible again, and I have not been bothered by tremors since.\nHowever, in late February I changed from Sinemet to Rytary\xa0 ER (3-36.25 mg-145 mg 3 times a day dosed 5 hours apart). The dosage was based on the equivalent amount of Sinemet that I was taking, but due to Rytary‚Äôs granule formulation (consisting of both instant and extended-release levodopa) about two-thirds of the levodopa is lost in the bowels and does not get absorbed, so although Rytary‚Äôs dose looked higher than Sinemet‚Äôs, with the conversion it is about the same. In short, dosing modifications are common during this transition to get it right as it‚Äôs not an exact science.\nHowever, after a week of 3 Rytary caps per dose, I decided to try taking only 2 caps per dose instead. The lower amount still provided an effective dose and I‚Äôve noticed only a slight increase in stiffness but no increased slowness, although slowness was not previously present. I‚Äôm a big fan of using the lowest effective medication dosing.\nMy new theory is by taking less levodopa now may provide some wiggle room when (if) levodopa-induced dyskinesia happens later on. It‚Äôs my understanding that levodopa dosing is usually increased with the onset of levodopa-induced dyskinesia, so if that happens I may not need as much levodopa increase in the future. I might add that I also added an oral CBD emulsion almost 2 years ago that has helped with other symptoms (primarily swallowing difficulties) and it may be helpful with motor symptoms resulting in the need for less levodopa, but that‚Äôs another story.\nHope this helps. You‚Äôll know when to start carbidopa-levodopa, but in the meantime keep on riding‚Äìmay there be more Parkinson folks on spokes! Btw, with many thanks to the Davis Phinney Foundation for PD, I discovered Patient Assistance Programs that help people in need to afford their meds, and Rytary is very expensive.

I tried several HIIT cycling classes at the YMCA. I loved the company, our sometimes black comedy like the time one of the cyclists was headed to the floor and the instructor made an incredible save, cradling his head. The rest of us erupted into clapping, hi-fives, whistles and catcalls, mystifying other gym rats.\nBut, the agony of those itty bitty bicycle seats, and the effect of the hunched form on the lower back made me give it up. Instead I gravitated to the gentle yoga classes, TaiChi, and Feldenkrais, popular in Europe and the U.K. They describe it as Awareness through Movement, where a skilled practitioner  guides you through a very individualized program of finding a different set of muscles and neurons  to circumvent the effects of loss caused by Parkinson‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a very adaptable approach to the myriad of seemingly random body part failures.\nAn example: I have severe osteoarthritis of the knee, so painful I have to limit any walking. My instructor worked with me on transferring weight side to side, using areas of the foot and ankle to grip the floor, then establish a rolling effect of the feet front to back, walking, but using a different neural pathway. From there she steered me through opening the pelvis, letting it take on more structural support. The effect of these conscious movements shifts pressure away from the knee, so walking is less painful. She also noticed I pair arm and leg on the same side when I walk,  rather than diagonal right leg/left arm and left leg/ right arm. Changing to the diagonals improves balance and stability. Though It‚Äôs hard to change something as basic as walking this approach is helpful.\nOvercoming fatigue is a huge problem. But since I like exercise class more than stuff I should be doing like paying bills, laundry, housework, etc., I play hooky by going to class.

That is the physiological model they are tied to, which they learn in all their training.\nIn my opinion,\xa0 the model is accurate for normal people. \xa0When normal people exercise, more dopamine is created and the signaling continues. But Parkies can‚Äôt make any more dopamine to match the increased need, so what little they have is oxidized, leaving\xa0 the exerciser with a feeling of exhaustion and weakness.

They said they were there because they had witnessed how much better\xa0people who were doing the PWR!Moves program performed in boxing class and they realized boxing wasn‚Äôt providing everything their participants needed!\nPD is the only progressive neurological brain disease in which the rate of progression can be affected by doing the\xa0right kinds of targeted functional exercise. The research and evidenced-based PWR!Moves program was developed specifically to target both the motor and non-motor symptoms of PD. PWR stands for\xa0Parkinson\xa0Wellness\xa0Recovery. It targets all of the functional movements we all need to do every day. Since we function in many different positions, we need to move and exercise in all of them as well. Just exercising in standing or sitting doesn‚Äôt help people with PD function better lying on their back, stomach or on all 4‚Äôs.\nThe PWR!Moves is a home-based daily program that is performed without any equipment and can be done anywhere there is room for an exercise mat on the floor. It can be adapted for anyone and at any stage of PD. PWR!Moves can be a standalone program or it can be integrated into any other form of exercise. It can be done while traveling, at work or on those cold snowy days when the roads are closed and you can‚Äôt get to the gym or exercise classes are canceled!\nResearch shows that it‚Äôs not just\xa0what\xa0we do, it‚Äôs\xa0how\xa0we do it that gives the best results. Parkinson‚Äôs disease causes stiffness (rigidity) in the body and tells people to move slower and smaller (bradykinesia). The key to the PWR!Moves is that it is an amplitude-based (moving BIG with high EFFORT) functional program that helps people to break through the stiffness and slow movement to move bigger and stronger!\nThe PWR!Moves also improves posture, balance, strength, agility and non-motor symptoms like sleep, fatigue, constipation and mood. It enhances and improves all aspects of everyday function including work, sports and hobbies. PWR!Moves reduce freezing and fall risk. Research shows the sooner after diagnosis people begin doing the PWR!Moves, the better they will do throughout life!\nIt‚Äôs so important to begin moving in the right ways as soon as possible to target the specific changes that come with a PD diagnosis. Please keep doing whatever exercise you love to do, BUT\xa0 please do PD-specific functional targeted amplitude training like PWR!Moves every day! Targeted amplitude-based exercise IS medicine for PD!\nFor more information on the research, the PWR!Moves, Dr. Becky Farley‚Äôs PWR!Gym or to find a certified PWR!Moves Therapist or Instructor in your area visit: pwr4life.org\nKeep Calm and PWR! on!\n'], ['Posts']]"

Thinking about those obligations and expectations (especially in bed at night) brings on much anxiety. As for thoughts on exercise, my greatest difficulty is apathy.

I‚Äôm usually totally exhausted by the time I get home, and often fall asleep for 10-20 minutes in a chair. I‚Äôm no good for chores until the next day. But I do feel better ( I tell myself). It‚Äôs been suggested that I would benefit from a less rigorous workout, but I have a hard time bringing myself to that.

The idea is to give people with a plethora of visible and invisible disabilities a platform to share their stories. You can also find the archives from this series here.\nI‚Äôve read a number of these essays before, and they‚Äôre fascinating. Topics range from disability rights to navigating the world of online dating with a disability.\nHere‚Äôs an excerpt from the synopsis on Amazon: ‚ÄúReflecting on the fraught conversations around disability‚Äïfrom the friend who says ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think of you as disabled,‚Äù to the father who scolds his child with attention differences, ‚ÄúStop it stop it stop it what is wrong with you?‚Äù‚Äïthe stories here reveal the range of responses, and the variety of consequences, to being labeled as ‚Äúdisabled‚Äù by the broader public.‚Äù\nI‚Äôd love to hear if any of you have read this book, or any of the essays from it. It‚Äôs great to see this kind of media representation.\nHas anyone here read this book? Do you have any favorite essays from it?\n'], ['Posts']]"

Selegiline had tyramine warnings and interactions. When Azilect was first approved it carried the same tyramine warnings since it was the same class of medication. After a sizeable population had used Azilect for a number of years I believe the FDA revised the prescribing information for Azilect to remove the tyramine dietary restrictions. I think doctors and pharmacists still advise caution out of an overabundance of caution. I wouldn‚Äôt eat a lot of stilton cheese but anything else should be fine. I‚Äôve never had any issues over the past 2.5 years. Again, please verify with your doctor and do your own research.\nAnother advantage of Azilect over Selegiline is that Selegiline breaks down into the metabolites\xa0methamphetamine and amphetamine which causes insomnia. Metabolism of Azilect is different and doesn‚Äôt have these same metabolites and doesn‚Äôt have the same insomnia issues that people experienced with Selegiline.\nThink of Azilect as a new and improved version of the older MAO-B inhibitor Selegiline.\nThe thing you really need to pay attention to with any MAO-B inhibitor including Azilect are the drug interactions! Always check with your pharmacist before taking anything, even OTC meds and herbal remedies while on Azilect. It interacts with dextromethorphan (cough syrup), tramadol, St John‚Äôs wort, Flexeril, sinus meds, Visine eye drops, etc. My doctor told me to tell my dentist to use lidocaine only for fillings and avoid anything with epinephrine which includes almost every standard anesthetic used by dentists except plain lidocaine. Before any surgery, your husband may need to discontinue Azilect for a couple of weeks to avoid interactions with anesthesia meds.\nHope this helps.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nScott and Mike, thanks for your comments.\xa0 I understand, Mike, that you are only sharing your experience.\xa0 Obviously it can be different for everyone and we have to make our own decisions.\xa0 That‚Äôs crazy to hear about Visine . . . really?!\xa0 I am still interested to hear from anyone else that takes Azilect with regard to your diet and any changes you felt you needed to make or any reactions you had while on it.\xa0 Thanks very much.\n'], ['\nI have been on Azilect for 6+ years.

(Remember, though, that people differ==some people are fatally allergic to peanuts.) I have not changed my diet, and eat cheddar cheese and even occasionally Asiago cheese. At one point a few years ago, my neurologist and I decided to test the effects of medication change, and I stopped taking rasagiline for a short while.

However, pramipexole made me so sleepy that eventually I stopped it altogether. Then when insomnia reared its ugly head, I went back to taking 1 mt at bedtime to help me sleep. After a while, I stopped it completely again and haven‚Äôt taken it since.\nMy advice is to work with your neurologist to experiment with your meds and see what works for you. Sometimes when I hit a low point (off time or exaustion time‚Äìsuch as after eating too much protein for breakfast‚ÄìI will take an extra 12.5/50 carbidopa/levodopa and that helps a lot. \nMy previous neurologist added entacapone to my growing handful of medications without explaining why.

That stopped the dystonia entirely and also took care of restless legs. The restless legs stopped immediately on the first dose, which was a big relief. However, as time went on I developed edema in the lower legs.\nAfter about 3 years of pramipexole, and increasing doses being needed, the water on the legs ended up causing a couple of large blisters which broke. They took a long time to heal. Since edema of the lower legs is listed as a side effect of pramipexole, we figured that was the case.\nThe doctor added Rytary,\xa0 slow release form of carbidopa/levodopa,\xa0 to my treatment, and we have been slowly reducing the dosage of pramipexole. The edema hasn‚Äôt gone down so it may be due to a different cause.\nBut the thing is, the Rytary has not produced the dystonia of the neck at all and it has been about a year since I started taking it. So that is a great relief. But it is very expensive, that is the only drawback.\nAs I reduced the pramipexole to 0.125mg 3 times/day my restless legs came back so we are continuing that at a dosage of 0.25 3 x per day.\nBut each person is different so what works for me might not for you.

My Physician feels that it was my fitness that kept me from being diagnosed sooner. For you fellas that are making fitness training part of your therapy, it might be insightful to know that when my gym closed for about 90 days, I found it very hard to duplicate the ‚ÄúNose to Toes‚Äù regimen I had followed three times a week since I started in 1962 at age 17 (To qualify fo SF). During that time, my tremors got worse, rigidity increased, sleep got worse and my dose times got closer. My gym reopened about about three weeks ago and with my routine returning all of those problems have begun to be reduced. One note: Now I have to wear a mask in the gym. After a lot of trials, I found the best mask was one with two exhalation valves (one on each side) and five layer (95) inbound air filter with ear loops and a Velcro strap at the rear of \xa0my neck. They are about $30 on Amazon and $20 on Wish.

I know I did.\nI was prescribed Azilect about 5-1/2 years ago, when I was first diagnosed. I began treatment, and like most people, I didn‚Äôt feel a thing. In my mind, I might as well have been taking a Flintstones vitamin for all the ‚Äúbeneficial effects‚Äù I was feeling. Nevertheless, I stuck with it, with the hope that it might be doing something deep inside that I wasn‚Äôt aware of.\n5-1/2 years later I‚Äôm still Stage 1.

I have no idea. But I‚Äôm certainly not going to quit taking it just because I don‚Äôt feel any miraculous effect from it.

Selegiline had tyramine warnings and interactions. When Azilect was first approved it carried the same tyramine warnings since it was the same class of medication. After a sizeable population had used Azilect for a number of years I believe the FDA revised the prescribing information for Azilect to remove the tyramine dietary restrictions. I think doctors and pharmacists still advise caution out of an overabundance of caution. I wouldn‚Äôt eat a lot of stilton cheese but anything else should be fine. I‚Äôve never had any issues over the past 2.5 years. Again, please verify with your doctor and do your own research.\nAnother advantage of Azilect over Selegiline is that Selegiline breaks down into the metabolites\xa0methamphetamine and amphetamine which causes insomnia. Metabolism of Azilect is different and doesn‚Äôt have these same metabolites and doesn‚Äôt have the same insomnia issues that people experienced with Selegiline.\nThink of Azilect as a new and improved version of the older MAO-B inhibitor Selegiline.\nThe thing you really need to pay attention to with any MAO-B inhibitor including Azilect are the drug interactions! Always check with your pharmacist before taking anything, even OTC meds and herbal remedies while on Azilect. It interacts with dextromethorphan (cough syrup), tramadol, St John‚Äôs wort, Flexeril, sinus meds, Visine eye drops, etc. My doctor told me to tell my dentist to use lidocaine only for fillings and avoid anything with epinephrine which includes almost every standard anesthetic used by dentists except plain lidocaine. Before any surgery, your husband may need to discontinue Azilect for a couple of weeks to avoid interactions with anesthesia meds.\nHope this helps.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nScott and Mike, thanks for your comments.\xa0 I understand, Mike, that you are only sharing your experience.\xa0 Obviously it can be different for everyone and we have to make our own decisions.\xa0 That‚Äôs crazy to hear about Visine . . . really?!\xa0 I am still interested to hear from anyone else that takes Azilect with regard to your diet and any changes you felt you needed to make or any reactions you had while on it.\xa0 Thanks very much.\n'], ['\nI have been on Azilect for 6+ years.

That stopped the dystonia entirely and also took care of restless legs. The restless legs stopped immediately on the first dose, which was a big relief. However, as time went on I developed edema in the lower legs.\nAfter about 3 years of pramipexole, and increasing doses being needed, the water on the legs ended up causing a couple of large blisters which broke. They took a long time to heal. Since edema of the lower legs is listed as a side effect of pramipexole, we figured that was the case.\nThe doctor added Rytary,\xa0 slow release form of carbidopa/levodopa,\xa0 to my treatment, and we have been slowly reducing the dosage of pramipexole. The edema hasn‚Äôt gone down so it may be due to a different cause.\nBut the thing is, the Rytary has not produced the dystonia of the neck at all and it has been about a year since I started taking it. So that is a great relief. But it is very expensive, that is the only drawback.\nAs I reduced the pramipexole to 0.125mg 3 times/day my restless legs came back so we are continuing that at a dosage of 0.25 3 x per day.\nBut each person is different so what works for me might not for you. I just offer this for your info.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nMike,\nThat‚Äôs very interesting about continuous motions. I‚Äôll have to ask my Dad if he has experienced similar things.

Based on some recommendations, I ordered one of those infomercial workout programs back in 2010. I was working for an organization where everyone worked from home and I needed a spark to stay active. A co-worker and I made a pact where we went through the program together and we got in the best shape of our lives within a few months. I‚Äôve built up a large video library of similar extreme cross-fit style workout programs as well as yoga and stretching over the years and do them regularly. They are definitely NOT for most people. People suffer a lot of injuries in extreme cross-fit programs that push you to your limits for many consecutive days. But, they work for me.\n'], ['Posts']]"

I was 29 years with the Salt Lake City Fire Department as a Firefighter/Paramedic and Captain. I am now 74 and was diagnosed about eight years ago.

I had stayed in pretty decent physical condition since my discharge \xa0from the Army and Army National Guard (U.S. Special Forces) 1963-1673 and through out my FD Carrier. My Physician feels that it was my fitness that kept me from being diagnosed sooner. For you fellas that are making fitness training part of your therapy, it might be insightful to know that when my gym closed for about 90 days, I found it very hard to duplicate the ‚ÄúNose to Toes‚Äù regimen I had followed three times a week since I started in 1962 at age 17 (To qualify fo SF). During that time, my tremors got worse, rigidity increased, sleep got worse and my dose times got closer. My gym reopened about about three weeks ago and with my routine returning all of those problems have begun to be reduced. One note: Now I have to wear a mask in the gym.

In my mind, I might as well have been taking a Flintstones vitamin for all the ‚Äúbeneficial effects‚Äù I was feeling.

I have no idea. But I‚Äôm certainly not going to quit taking it just because I don‚Äôt feel any miraculous effect from it.

Selegiline had tyramine warnings and interactions. When Azilect was first approved it carried the same tyramine warnings since it was the same class of medication. After a sizeable population had used Azilect for a number of years I believe the FDA revised the prescribing information for Azilect to remove the tyramine dietary restrictions. I think doctors and pharmacists still advise caution out of an overabundance of caution. I wouldn‚Äôt eat a lot of stilton cheese but anything else should be fine. I‚Äôve never had any issues over the past 2.5 years. Again, please verify with your doctor and do your own research.\nAnother advantage of Azilect over Selegiline is that Selegiline breaks down into the metabolites\xa0methamphetamine and amphetamine which causes insomnia. Metabolism of Azilect is different and doesn‚Äôt have these same metabolites and doesn‚Äôt have the same insomnia issues that people experienced with Selegiline.\nThink of Azilect as a new and improved version of the older MAO-B inhibitor Selegiline.\nThe thing you really need to pay attention to with any MAO-B inhibitor including Azilect are the drug interactions! Always check with your pharmacist before taking anything, even OTC meds and herbal remedies while on Azilect. It interacts with dextromethorphan (cough syrup), tramadol, St John‚Äôs wort, Flexeril, sinus meds, Visine eye drops, etc. My doctor told me to tell my dentist to use lidocaine only for fillings and avoid anything with epinephrine which includes almost every standard anesthetic used by dentists except plain lidocaine.

I wake up feeling good with minimal shakes and balance issues and havnt fallen out of bed again since.\xa0 Also my GP increased my Citalopram as well as gave me 10, .05Ativan to take if my anxiety is really bad. (Not all at once haha),\xa0 So far so good.\xa0 I have been having massage which not just relaxes me and helps my anxiety but my tremors too.\xa0 As well I am doing physio so I have exercises specific to me.\xa0 I continue to use the treadmill and hold on for dear life but most always feel good after I do it so yes I do see the benefit in exercise.\xa0 As far as the counseling goes the first session was ok in that we concluded I was depressed which I hadnt considered because of my good spirits .\xa0 I scheduled another much needed appointment that never happened due to the counselor and insurance company‚Äôs choice of service provider that left much to be desired but that is another topic that I will call ‚ÄúFits of Anger ‚Äúon my next post lol. I was surprised at how terribly upset I was when the counselor failed to call and it made me look at other areas that I am angry about.\xa0 I worked for a crisis/suicide as well as an abused women and their children 10 bed facility for almost 20 years so you would think Id have more insight.\xa0 So that‚Äôs the latest.\xa0 Thanks again for listening.\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n\xa0\n'], ['\nThank you David.\xa0 I appreciate any and all information I can gather.\n'], ['\nThank you, everyone, for sharing your experiences and speaking so honestly and openly about mental health/anxiety.
