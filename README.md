<h2> The aim of this study </h2>
<p> Sentiment analysis models are mostly used to evaluate the convoyed sentiments by patients’ narratives gathered from multiple information sources, assess positive or negative clinical outcomes or judge the impact of a drug and a medical condition.<br/> 
  Their effectiveness depends mainly on the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) method applied to the medical domain. Indeed, connotative meaning and sentiment associated with natural language concepts exhibit additional structural ambiguities including lack of multi-word concepts senses, multiple sense modalities of an individual concept, biomedical concepts abbreviations, pragmatic, and descriptive or nontechnical medical terms and multi-source health and medical data fusion issues. Biomedical meaning is only meaningful in reference to, and in distinction from, other meanings that need to be justified according to the context in which the concepts occur. <br/>
In this study, we develop a semisupervised features-fusion based approach for medical sense disambiguation, offering a significant rate of biomedical concept senses discrimination and seeking constraints from conjunctions of the positive or negative semantics of aspects-based sentiment information.

<h2> Datasets Samples </h2>
we collected varied patients generated narratives datasets from popular platforms  the experiments on multi-source data from Twitter and health-related forums such as Parkinson's Disease (PD). 
<h3> Parkinson's disease forum data </h3>
<h4> Dataset Samples Overview</h4>
<p> 
<a href ='https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/forums/forums/topic/the-long-awaited-mannitol-interview/' target="_blank"> Parkinson disease forum </a> 
is a forum for long-term degenerative disorder-related discussions. We chose this forum because of the controversy of Parkinson’s disease related-experiences and the difficulties to distill insights from these shared narratives. Indeed, PD affects an estimated seven to 10 million people and families 
worldwide. Reports pour daily into healthcare communities. We added some samples of data we collected.  </br>
