<a href ='https://parkinsonsnewstoday.com/forums/forums/topic/the-long-awaited-mannitol-interview/' target="_blank"> Parkinson disease forum </a> 
is a forum for long-term degenerative disorder-related discussions. We chose this forum because of the controversy of Parkinson’s disease
related-experiences and the difficulties to distill insights from these shared narratives. Indeed, PD affects an estimated seven to 10 million people and families 
worldwide. Reports pour daily into healthcare communities. A sample of 2807 PD-related posts were collected from a popular online healthcare community of Parkinson’s disease.
